I’m starting to get the feeling that Earth is some kind of lesson learning place, some kind of “hell,” a “time-out session” for bad children.
That doesn’t suggest that every single aspect of this existence is hellish, or that there isn’t beauty in life, but consider this.
If we just look at the most basic, inherent ways life on Earth functions, we might be able to notice a few things.
All organisms on Earth stay alive by nourishing themselves with food, or air, or water. Every organism, from humans to bacteria, is in a constant process of obtaining nourishment to stay alive.
or not.
of some kind.
On an individual level, people are always fiending for something. Then that behavior can be observed on a different scale with the more wealthy and powerful people in the world.
So that’s the first thing: why is this entire planet in a non-stop cycle of consumption? In many ways it’s beautiful, it’s not all evil, but it really is a world of organisms consuming organisms for nourishment. Maybe this isn’t how all planes of existence work.
for something outside ourselves for fulfillment, things start to fall into place.
and things in life fall into place serendipitously.
Maybe the world seems so populated by people who are stubborn to not learn their lessons, people who are stagnant, because that’s a main theme here.
It’s hard to approach this concept without going into theories about past life and karma which may imply the belief that people who suffer in this world deserve what they get, but it might actually be this way.
but there must be some kind of rule of karma taking place.

. Some believe astrology is a of piece of the code, a physical mechanism by which souls incarnate here (just to name one theory).

http://csglobe.com/5-cartels-rule-america-world/
Americans have been programmed to fight amongst themselves along partisan political lines, always pointing the finger at the other side of the phony left-right paradigm.
Divide and conquer is the broad tactic being used to keep people from recognizing, focusing on, and targeting the truly diabolical agents in our world who hold real power over all of us at once.
We are not ruled by Republicans or Democrats, but rather by the not-so-hidden hands of institutions which have consolidated a tremendous amount of power.
Our world is deeply colored by these cartels, and they impact every area of our lives, constantly maneuvering to make more and more dependent on them for our needs.
In short, these are the organizations which rule over us.
These are the great forces in our world which prevent positive change and ensure that we continually slide downward into tyranny and self-destruction.
The geopolitical financial elite have for centuries been organizing to consolidate the mechanisms of wealth into the hands of a very few.
are the popular face of this cartel, but the banking and financial corruption goes far, far beyond their influence.
Banks are in a unique position of power in our world, and can generate extraordinary profits without actually producing anything.
Through the issuance of currency and credit, they can control the amount of money available to the economy and create economic booms and busts, seizing titles to land, homes, businesses, and property.
They hold extraordinary influence over government for their role as financiers of everything from public works to war, and enjoy extraordinary pecuniary advantage and privilege.
Combine this with the new influence of supra-national organizations like the Bank of International Settlements and the World Bank, and you realize that the world is on the cusp of falling into the greatest trap of all time.  The banking cartel is the primary source of war, destabilization and military grade destruction in our world today.
Human health has been hijacked by the medical establishment which forces people into an extraordinarily expensive program of dependence on insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and other health services providers.
Interestingly, the medical industry is also a major cause of premature death for Americans as malpractice, drug overdoses, botched procedures and poor patient care contribute to these statistics.
Medical errors alone are the third leading cause of death in the U.S.
Additionally, the government deliberately serves these corporate interests by limiting and preventing information and access to services and healing modalities which may produce positive results without dependence on hospitals and physicians.
Furthermore, this cartel actually contributes knowingly to human misery by pumping deadly drugs like opioids in our world, scheming to get as many people as addicted as possible in order to cut a greater profit.
The raping of the planet for fossil fuel energy is something that has been going on for decades, but is finally now beginning to create substantial blowback as environmental destruction is proving to be something that cannot be ignored any longer.
which demonstrate that nuclear energy simply cannot be contained and is a threat to all life on planet earth.
We are witnessing major growth in the sectors of renewable energy, but the traditional energy industry has a long history of interfering with the release of alternative technologies, even going so far as to actively suppress technologies.
This cartel has shaped our world in dramatic ways, most notably by creating near universal dependence on the automobile as the primary form of transportation, which has shaped both our cities and our mindsets.
The never-ending push for oil exploration is killing the most precious environmental resources we have left, but the influence of the energy cartel is so great that it can practically buy entire nations, such as Ecuador, where foreign oil ventures are allowed to press ever further into the Amazon.
The industrial agro chemical giants have completely changed the face of farming on planet earth within the last 75 years or so. Family farms continue to go under at a record-setting pace, and it is clear that the endgame of companies like Monsanto is to own the patents to all food seed, lording over a planet where people are prosecuted for planting food crops.
This is quite startling, and when couple with the fact that seed biodiversity is collapsing around us, it may only be another ten years before this endgame is realized.
, destroying the soil and causing horrible health problems for people living near farms.
This institution is the newest in our world, consisting of what is now commonly referred to as ‘Big Data,’ meaning the corporations and government agencies which collect data points on everything in our world and use this information strategically for their interests.
Half a century ago, outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower coined the term “military-industrial complex” to describe the fascistic collusion between the Pentagon and America’s burgeoning armaments industry. But in our day and age we are witnessing the rise of a new collusion, one between the Pentagon and the tech industry that it helped to seed, that is committed to waging a covert war against people the world over. Now, in the 21st century, it is time to give this new threat a name: the information-industrial complex.
Corbett’s recent video explains the rise of this all powerful institution in the following presentation.

http://csglobe.com/california-solar-power-installations-new-homes/
The world’s fifth largest economy —and possibly the first government in the world—is about to require solar panels for all new homes.
The California Energy Commission will hold a vote on Wednesday, May 9, on whether to put the new standard into effect.
If passed, which is expected, the solar mandate would apply to all homes, condos, and apartment buildings up to three stories high as of January 1, 2020, with exceptions for structures built in the shade and offsets available for other energy-saving measures, such as installing batteries like the Tesla Powerwall.
At present, only 15 to 20% of new single-family homes in the state include solar installations.
The mandate would make it $25,000 to $30,000 more expensive to build new homes than those built to the current code, established in 2006.
But experts say that extra cost, which accounts for both solar installation and improved insulation, would be recouped over the life of the home in savings on energy bills.
Owners are expected to save $50,000 to $60,000 in operating costs over 25 years. Officials say this plan would do one better than the goal of net-zero energy.
all new buildings under 10 stories to be fitted with solar panels, following the example of smaller Californian towns such as Lancaster and Sebastopol.
are aggressively pursuing increased reliance on solar power, but none have yet gone as far as the California mandate would.
Solar power is not the only area where California is bullish on the environment. Earlier this month, the state led a coalition that filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to prevent the EPA from lowering vehicle emissions standards and preventing states from setting their own.
As the fifth largest economy in the world, California’s higher fuel standards have helped push automakers to embrace fuel efficiency.
California Governor Jerry Brown has led California’s recent push for the environment. His fourth and final term in office will end on January 1, 2019.

Most people are unaware that one of the greatest threats to their freedom may be a United Nations program which plans to depopulate 95% of the world.

, the plan calls for governments to take control of all land use and not leave any of the decision making in the hands of private property owners.
It is assumed that people are not good stewards of their land and the government will do a better job if they are in control.
Individual rights in general are to give way to the needs of communities as determined by the governing body.
Moreover, people should be rounded up off the land and packed into human settlements, or islands of human habitation, close to employment centers and transportation. Another program, called the Wildlands Project spells out how most of the land is to be set aside for non-humans.
Agenda 21 policies date back to the 1970’s but it got its real start in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro when President Bush signed onto it. President Clinton signed it later and continued the program in the United States.
Agenda 21 is ‘soft-law’ and did not have to be voted on by the Congress. A non-governmental organization called the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives, ICLEI, is tasked with carrying out the goals of Agenda 21.
Over 600 cities in the U.S. are members, and that number is growing. The costs are paid by taxpayers.

http://csglobe.com/japan-huge-rare-earth-mineral-deposit-supply-world-centuries/
This could change the global economy.
Researchers have found a deposit of rare-earth minerals off the coast of Japan that could supply the world for centuries, according to a new study.
The study, published in the journal Nature on Tuesday, says the deposit contains 16 million tons of the valuable metals.
to electric vehicles. By definition, these minerals contain one or more of 17 metallic rare-earth elements (for those familiar with the periodic table, those are on the second row from the bottom).
according to the USGS.
Currently, there are only a few economically viable areas where they can be mined and they’re generally expensive to extract.
China has tightly controlled much of the world’s supply of these minerals for decades. That has forced Japan – a major electronics manufacturer – to rely on prices dictated by their neighbour.
The newly discovered deposit is enough to “supply these metals on a semi-infinite basis to the world,” the study’s authors wrote in the paper.
There’s enough yttrium to meet the global demand for 780 years, dysprosium for 730 years, europium for 620 years, and terbium for 420 years.
The cache lies off of Minamitori Island, about 1,150 miles (1,850 km) southeast of Tokyo. It’s within Japan’s exclusive economic zone, so the island nation has the sole rights to the resources there.
.
.
reports. China was forced to start exporting more of the minerals again after the dispute was taken up at the World Trade Organisation.
Rare-earth minerals can be formed by volcanic activity, but many of the minerals on our planet were formed initially by supernova explosions before Earth came into existence.
When Earth was formed, the minerals were incorporated into the deepest portions of the planet’s mantle, a layer of rock beneath the crust.
As tectonic activity has moved portions of the mantle around, rare earth minerals have found their way closer to the surface.
The process of weathering – in which rocks break down into sediment over millions of years – spread these rare minerals all over the planet.
The only thing holding Japan back from using its newly found deposit to dominate the global market for rare-earth minerals is the challenge involved in extracting them.
.
Rare-earth minerals are likely to remain part the backbone of some the fastest-growing sectors of the global tech economy.
Japan now has the opportunity to control a huge chunk of the global supply, forcing countries that manufacture electronics, like China and the US, to purchase the minerals on Japan’s terms.

http://csglobe.com/current-industrial-civilization/
Imagine dinosaurs driving tiny dinosaur cars.
As a species, we humans tend to take it for granted that we are the only ones that live in sedentary communities, use tools, and alter our landscape to meet our needs.
It is also a foregone conclusion that in the history of planet Earth, humans are the only species to develop machinery, automation, electricity, and mass communications – the hallmarks of industrial civilization.
that considers how such a civilization could be found and how this could have implications in the search for extra-terrestrial life.
(NASA GISS) and an astronomer from the University of Rochester, respectively.
As they indicate in their study, the search for life on other planets has often involved looking to Earth-analogues to see what kind conditions life could exist under.
However, this pursuit also entails the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (SETI) that would be capable of communicating with us. Naturally, it is assumed that any such civilization would need to develop and industrial base first.
This, in turn, raises the question of how often an industrial civilization might develop – what Schmidt and Frank refer to as the “Silurian Hypothesis”. Naturally, this raises some complications since humanity is the only example of an industrialized species that we know of.
In addition, humanity has only been an industrial civilization for the past few centuries – a mere fraction of its existence as a species and a tiny fraction of the time that complex life has existed on Earth.
For the sake of their study, the team first noted the importance of this question to the Drake Equation.
To recap, this theory states that the number of civilizations (N) in our galaxy that we might be able to communicate is equal to the average rate of star formation (R*), the fraction of those stars that have planets (fp), the number of planets that can support life (ne), the number of planets that will develop life (fl), the number of planets that will develop intelligent life (fi), the number civilizations that would develop transmission technologies (fc), and the length of time these civilizations will have to transmit signals into space (L).
“If over the course of a planet’s existence, multiple industrial civilizations can arise over the span of time that life exists at all, the value of fc may in fact be greater than one.
In short, thanks to improvements in instrumentation and methodology, scientists have been able to determine the rate at which stars form in our galaxy.
Furthermore, recent surveys for extra-solar planets have led some astronomers to estimate that our galaxy could contains as many as 100 billion potentially-habitable planets.
If evidence could be found of another civilization in Earth’s history, it would further constrain the Drake Equation.
They then address the likely geologic consequences of human industrial civilization and then compare that fingerprint to potentially similar events in the geologic record.
“Since the mid-18th century, humans have released over 0.5 trillion tons of fossil carbon via the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, at a rate orders of magnitude faster than natural long-term sources or sinks.
They also consider increased rates of sediment flow in rivers and its deposition in coastal environments, as a result of agricultural processes, deforestation, and the digging of canals.
The spread of domesticated animals, rodents and other small animals are also considered – as are the extinction of certain species of animals – as a direct result of industrialization and the growth of cities.
or nuclear testing) will also leave a mark on the geological record – in the case of radioactive isotopes, sometimes for millions of years.
These events were specifically considered because they coincided with rises in temperatures, increases in carbon and oxygen isotopes, increased sediment, and depletions of oceanic oxygen.
Events that had a very clear and distinct cause, such as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event (caused by an asteroid impact and massive volcanism) or the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (the onset of Antarctic glaciation) were not considered.
According to the team, the events they did consider (known as “hyperthermals”) show similarities to the Anthropocene fingerprint that they identified.
“[A] fascinating sequence of events lasting 100–200 kyr and involving a rapid input (in perhaps less than 5 kyr) of exogenous carbon into the system, possibly related to the intrusion of the North American Igneous Province into organic sediments.
Finally, the team addressed some possible research directions that might improve the constraints on this question. This, they claim, could consist of a “deeper exploration of elemental and compositional anomalies in extant sediments spanning previous events be performed”.
In other words, the geological record for these extinction events should be examined more closely for anomalies that could be associated with industrial civilization.
If any anomalies are found, they further recommend that the fossil record could be examined for candidate species, which would raise questions about their ultimate fate.
Of course, they also acknowledge that more evidence is necessary before the Silurian Hypothesis can be considered viable.
For instance, many past events where abrupt climate change took place have been linked to changes in volcanic/tectonic activity.
Second, there is the fact that current changes in our climate are happening faster than in any other geological period. However, this is difficult to say for certain since there are limits when it comes to the chronology of the geological record.
In the end, more research will be necessary to determine how long previous extinction events (those that were not due to impacts) took as well.
.
Here too, the authors suggest how explorations of both could reveal the existence of past civilizations, and maybe even bolster the possibility of finding evidence of past civilizations on Earth.
Two key aspects of the Drake Equation, which addresses the probability of finding life elsewhere in the galaxy, are the sheer number of stars and planets out there and the amount of time life has had to evolve.
Until now, it has been assumed that one planet would give rise to one intelligent species capable of advanced technology and communications.
But if this number should prove to be more, we may a find a galaxy filled with civilizations, both past and present.

http://csglobe.com/trump-administration-just-ended-program-monitors-carbon-emissions/
You know, the stuff that's causing climate change.
Apparently, withdrawing from the Paris climate accord wasn’t enough. Now, the Trump administration wants to restrict the world’s ability to measure carbon emissions.
(CMS) – a $10 million-a-year research project, which monitors the flow of Earth’s carbon.
The move jeopardizes plans to verify the national emission cuts agreed to in the Paris climate accords, argues Kelly Sims Gallagher, director of Tufts University’s Center for International Environment and Resource Policy.
.
A mistake, or maybe an insidious way to attack climate science on a global scale.
that the CMS was an obvious target for the Trump administration.
Obvious, because over the past year, Trump and his administration have repeatedly attacked climate science and climate research. And also obvious because Trump has proposed cancelling the CMS in the past.
and other climate missions. And while the cuts ultimately didn’t pass Congress, NASA’s CMS project was conspicuously missing from a recent spending deal signed by Congress in March.
Now, it makes sense why.
When it comes to supporting Earth science research, the reach and breadth of the CMS is impressive.
The CMS has supported projects that help understand the carbon locked away in our forests and it has provided crucial research on the improvement of tropical forest carbon inventories – all of which help nations around the world to reduce their carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.
The CMS can also help cities and countries map their greenhouse gas emissions and help identify ways to reduce them, like it has done in the past.
he was disappointed by NASA’s decision.
This doesn’t mean that all carbon monitoring and measuring is gone. It just means that leadership in this area will most likely be passed on to Europe, which has one carbon-monitoring satellite of its own, and more on the way.
“We really shoot ourselves in the foot if we let other people develop the technology,” said Duffy.
For critics of NASA’s new administrator, Jim Bridenstine, the news should not come as a surprise.
he has been a fierce opponent of NASA’s Earth Science Program.
moving earth science research out of the science agency altogether.
Faced with growing resistance from Congress, Bridenstine walked back some of his beliefs and reiterated his support for NASA’s Earth Science Program.
But many did not believe him.
There is simply no excuse for voting for someone so unqualified to run NASA. They aren’t even bothering to make the argument that he will be a good administrator. They are just voting yes and getting out of town. For me this is a good reminder that elections have consequences.
Bridenstine has been at NASA for less than a month and he has already confirmed his critic’s worst fears.

http://csglobe.com/government-funded-stoned-marijuana-app-tells-you-youre-stoned/
If you have to ask...
If you’ve ever wondered how stoned you are, take comfort in the fact that you’re not alone: Government officials are wondering the same thing.
With the drug becoming increasingly prevalent in mainstream society, officials are seeking new ways to ensure highway and workplace safety don’t suffer while people are getting legally stoned.
announced their research on a mobile phone app that can tell whether you’re too stoned to do stuff.
, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago, presented the app at the annual meeting of the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics on Tuesday.
The app, called Am I Stoned?, is still in its research phase, but Pabon’s preliminary results suggest that the concept is on firm ground.
It’s just as well, considering that scientists trying to create a marijuana breathalyzer still haven’t figured it out.
‘Am I Stoned’ puts the user through several tasks to determine just how stoned they are.
Here’s how the app works: Anyone who’s gotten stoned knows that pot interferes with your ability to do stuff, so the researchers figured they could indirectly measure how high a person is by tracking how badly they performed on certain digital tasks.
, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Some consumed 7.5 milligrams of THC (a mild dose), some got 15 milligrams, and some just got a placebo.
Each participant then performed tests on a computer and shorter tasks on a mobile phone, all of which were meant to measure their cognitive speed, reaction time, fine motor ability, and memory.
The team got mixed results, but the study is a good start. “Performance was impaired by THC in three of the four computer tasks, but only one of the iPhone tasks,” they wrote in their presentation abstract. Measuring a stoned person’s impairment, it seems, takes more time than an iPhone tasks allows.
Since this early version of the test was most effective on a computer, it’s not very convenient for real-world use. And since the researchers say it requires 15 to 20 minutes to achieve sufficient sensitivity, a convenient version of the current test probably wouldn’t be sensitive enough.
So Pabon and her colleagues next must ensure the app is sensitive and convenient — while still being accurate.
They might want to take a cue from marijuana users themselves. The most accurate assessments of impairment, ironically, came from the study participants, who generally were very aware that they were stoned.
“With regard to self-assessments, subjects were in general accurate in their awareness of impairments on the tasks,” the team wrote.
‘Am I Stoned’ measures reaction time, among other things.
make it quick and easy for people to do that kind of self-assessment.
In the meantime, with no mobile app or marijuana breathalyzer to test your stoned-ness, you’re still going to have to use your own judgment.
And since marijuana does seem to be associated with deadly car crashes, an app that can help you tell whether you’re safe to drive does seem like a welcome addition. Let’s just hope the government founders aren’t tracking your test results.

.
The journal is making the entire article available for free on its website.
The 2017 presentation was actually a revision of Musk’s original audacious Mars vision from the previous year’s meeting in Mexico.
, but it’s currently behind a paywall.
The latest plans offer an update on the development of the SpaceX “BFR” rocket that Musk hopes will ferry about 100 people at a time to the red planet.
He also explained how how he hopes to finance his Mars ambitions by using BFR for all sorts of other uses, from resupplying the International Space Station to moon landings and collecting old satellites and other space junk.
Musk said the rocket could even be used for commercial super-fast international flights, via space.
There are still a daunting amount of details to work out before anyone sets foot on Mars, but since making his latest presentation, Musk has made progress.
You may have heard that SpaceX finally launched its long-awaited Falcon Heavy rocket — a bridge model of sorts between the Falcon 9 and BFR — and that it was a roaring success.

filed patents for a range of innovative products.
The first, and most successful, of his exploits was a refrigerator. In the 1920s, nascent refrigerators used highly toxic, corrosive, or flammable compounds like sulfur dioxide or methyl formate as refrigerants.
When passed through tubes and chambers while being pressurized and depressurized, these chemicals could efficiently cool a target chamber. However, moving them around required motors, and thus moving parts, which were subject to breaking down or leaking.
When Einstein read a news article about an entire family in Berlin who died in their sleep by breathing in leaking refrigerant fumes, he resolved to do something about it.
He and his colleague Leo Szilard thus spent the early 1930s designing a refrigerator that utilized calmer chemicals – butane, ammonia and water – as well as an ingenious electromagnetic pump. The system required no internal moving parts and was completely sealed. All it needed was an external heat source in the form of a contained natural gas flame.
Alas, Einstein and Szilard’s refrigerator was not at all efficient and it was very loud. Moreover, freon soon arrived on the market as a safe, non-toxic refrigerant to remedy the problem Einstein originally sought to solve.
vaccine cooler for use in the developing world.
Einstein’s next inventing foray was in the realm of auditory technology. He and German inventor Rudolf Goldschmidt aimed to design an electro-acoustical hearing aid.
The duo were granted a patent for an “electromagnetic sound reproduction apparatus” in 1934, but were forced to end their collaboration when both fled Germany during the rise of the Third Reich.
A year later, Albert Einstein was at it again, this time working with his longtime friend Gustav Peter Bucky to create a camera (pictured at the top of the article) that automatically adjusted to ambient light levels. They succeeded.
In their design, light would strike a photoelectric cell inside the camera, powering a shaft connected to screens of varying transparency. Depending on the light intensity, the photoelectric cell would adjust which screen would go in front of the main lens.
in December 1936 declared.
, in 1938 using a design different from Einstein’s.
. Yes, a blouse.
“Be it known that I, Albert Einstein, a citizen of the German Republic, residing in the Borough of Manhattan, county of New York, and State of New York, have invented a new, original, and ornamental Design for a Blouse,” Einstein wrote on the patent application.
Aside from its refined, futuristic flair, the garment stood out for its adjustable waistline. Einstein perhaps saw a market in aging, stylish men with burgeoning bellies.

The researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to “one to two of the five portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be significant and meaningful in terms of human nutrition, if information linking these [compounds] to the health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and whole grain consumption is confirmed”.

http://csglobe.com/oumuamua-asteroid-likely-came-from-tatooine-like-star-system/
, an asteroid dubbed ‘Oumuamua. New research suggests this visitor from afar likely came from a binary star system, and that astronomers should be on the lookout for both interstellar asteroids and comets.
Traveling at a mind-bending speed of 67,100 miles per hour (the equivalent of mach 88 at sea level), the distinctly cigar-shaped ‘Oumuamua zipped through our Solar System in October 2017.
The closest it came to Earth was 20.5 million miles (33 million km), and with its speed and extreme angle of entry, the object headed back towards interstellar space.
Naturally, as the first interstellar object ever detected, ‘Oumuamua (pronounced “oh-moo-ah-moo-ah” and meaning “a messenger from afar arriving first”) has been under intense scientific investigation.
Scientists made sure it wasn’t an alien spaceship, they determined its chemical composition, and even wondered if similar objects may have seeded Earth with extraterrestrial microbes in the past.
, published this week in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, investigated the types of environments most likely to produce and fling such objects into interstellar space.
‘Oumuamua, according to the new study, most likely originated in a binary star system, one reminiscent of Luke Skywalker’s fictional homeworld of Tatooine. The star system where ‘Oumuamua originated was very young, and still in the process of forming planets.
Using computer models, University of Toronto-Scarborough astronomer Alan Jackson tested the conditions under which celestial bodies such as asteroids and comets might be hurled by their host stars into the great unknown.
Our own solar system tosses the odd object into interstellar space, but the bulk of these objects are comets that form far from Earth, and are only very loosely bound by the Sun’s gravity; every once in a while, an Oort Cloud comet jostles free, embarking on its new life as a celestial orphan.
But ‘Oumuamua is not a comet—it’s very a much a solid chunk of rock, with no obvious traces of ice, gas, or a cometary tail. Jackson’s analysis suggests the odds are slim that this interstellar visitor was ejected from a system featuring a single star, or even a binary system where the stars are located far apart and exerting weak gravitational forces between the two.
Now, it’s not impossible, it’s just highly improbable. More realistically, ‘Oumuamua was tossed from a hot, nascent binary star system still in its planet-making mode. The stars were likely big and heavy, and surrounded by lots of material—some of which managed to escape owing to the many gravitational perturbations caused by the two stars in close proximity to each other.
Jackson then looked at the known population of binary stars, and showed that there are a lot of systems in the galaxy capable of flinging rocky objects into space. Around four in every five star systems feature two or more stellar objects.
Importantly, this is conjecture, albeit conjecture informed by statistics and computer models. We don’t actually know which type of star or star system produced ‘Oumuamua, but this study paints a picture of a probable scenario.
That said, it’s interesting to note that binary systems are likely to toss both asteroids and comets into interstellar space in roughly equal proportions, according to this research.
Astronomers should therefore be on the lookout for both types of objects, and not be surprised to find an interstellar comet with an active coma, in which the Sun warms the object’s gas and ice, creating a tail. Overall, however, lone stars (like ours) and binary systems should distribute more interstellar comets than asteroids.
So how weird is it that the first interstellar object ever discovered is among the rarer kind? Pretty weird, but that’s how science works sometimes. The next object to visit our solar system—based on probability—should be a comet. But as ‘Oumuamua showed us, nothing is guaranteed.

Deregulation kills more people in this country than ISIS ever will.
Investigators believe a worker dragging his foot along a factory floor sparked a Thursday explosion at a Texas chemical plant that injured two workers and left a third unaccounted for, and fears of another blast amid the toxic chemicals prevented crews from battling the ensuing blaze, an official said. Nine emergency-rescue and fire departments responded to the blaze at the Tri-Chem Industries plant in Cresson, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Dallas, but were evacuated from the vicinity because of risk of exposure and of another explosion, Cresson Mayor Bob Cornett told The Associated Press. The worker who dragged his foot while chemicals were being mixed caught fire from the waist up and was airlifted with critical burn injures to a Dallas hospital. Another worker with less severe injuries also was treated at a hospital. Cornett identified the missing worker as 27-year-old Dylan Mitchell.
And, as usual, the state government in Texas is right on the ball.
We could tell you what poisons you’re breathing right now as the fire continues to burn but, if we did, the terrorists would win.

http://csglobe.com/new-alien-species-invasions-still-rising-globally/
Up to 16% of all species on Earth could qualify as potential alien species and if they invade new regions, impacts will be difficult to predict, according to new research involving UCL.
—those never before encountered as aliens—continues to rise, posing a significant challenge to biosecurity interventions worldwide.
Approaches to tackle the growing issue largely rely on knowledge of species’ invasion history elsewhere, giving new previously unrecorded alien species a higher chance of slipping through border controls and eluding early response management.
and led by scientists at Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F), the University of Vienna and UCL, analysed a global database of 45,984 records detailing the first invasions of 16,019 established alien species from 1500 until 2005 to investigate the dynamics of how alien species spread worldwide.
Between the years 2000 and 2005, one quarter of records are of species that had not previously been found anywhere as an alien, which is a worryingly high proportion.
For plants, mammals, and fishes, the proportion of newly emerging alien species has remained constant during the last 150 years but the total number of alien species has increased.
Insects, molluscs and other invertebrates have the highest proportion of emerging alien species. Birds are the only group exempt from the trend, showing the lowest proportions of emerging alien species, with a distinct decline noted recently.
“Humans have been moving species to new places for thousands of years, so we might have expected that most species that have the potential to become aliens would already have done so. Instead, it seems the pool of new aliens is far from dry” explained study co-author, Professor Tim Blackburn (UCL Genetics, Evolution & Environment, and Zoological Society of London).
Previously, growth in alien species numbers has been largely attributed to increases in import volumes, human mobility and land-degradation.
However, statistical models in this study suggest that the high proportion of emerging alien species cannot be solely explained by these drivers and is actually likely to be due to the incorporation of new regions as a source of potential alien species invasions. The team estimated that there are therefore many potential alien species yet to emerge.
“With measures being taken to prevent alien species introductions and spread, there has been a decline in the proportions of newly emerging alien species from established sources, such as historical European colonies.
However, this decrease has been offset by newly emerging alien species elsewhere and it is likely that we can expect many more new alien species invasions starting to appear from regions with large and growing economies,” explained co-author Dr. Ellie Dyer (UCL Genetics, Evolution & Environment and ZSL).
“These findings will be extremely helpful for horizon scanning studies that aim to identify “door knocker” species, which are those not yet recorded but are suspected of presenting a high risk of arrival and detrimental impacts.

http://csglobe.com/fbi-vault-world-interested-right-now/
has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years, especially thanks to the plethora of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.
Tons of government agencies have declassified an overwhelming number of documents exposing not only the existence of UFOs, but the frequency at which they’re spotted and the physics-defying maneuvers that they carryout.
Of course, UFOs don’t necessarily equate to extraterrestrial technology; however, a significant amount of people have come forward discussing the existence of extraterrestrial (ET) life, including civilian eye witnesses, military personnel, and government officials from around the world.
This isn’t the first time someone has speculated that we are not alone in the cosmos and that ETs are watching over us and have even intervened in warfare.
There are hundreds of high ranking military whistleblowers who have testified to this.
“In one of the cases during the cold war, 1961, there were about 50 UFOs in formation flying South from Russia across Europe. The supreme allied commander was very concerned and was about ready to press the panic button when they turned around and went back over the North Pole.
They decided to do an investigation and they investigated for three years and they decided that with absolute certainty that four different species, at least, have been visiting this planet for thousands of years.
There’s been a lot more activity in the past two decades, especially since we invented the atomic bomb. They are very concerned about that and if we will use it again, because the whole cosmos is in unity and it affects not just us but other people in the cosmos.
Over a period of only two years, this FBI document has been viewed approximately a million times and is the most popular document on the FBI’s website.
It’s only a page long, but it’s gained enough popularity that it has people wondering more about the UFO phenomenon.
The FBI document is a memo dated May 22, 1950 written by Guy Hottel, who was the head of the FBI field office in Washington, D.C. at the time.
.
It seems strange that such an important finding wouldn’t be further investigated, which begs the question: Why didn’t this merit further research? Why weren’t the three bodies heavily tested? Perhaps they were, but like many other topics related to UFO and ET phenomena, we’re being kept in the dark.
This wasn’t the first UFO sighting in New Mexico either. One of the most infamous UFO crashes took place only a few years prior in 1947 in Roswell, New Mexico.
For years, conspiracy theorists and journalists alike deemed the Roswell incident as one of the most obvious pieces of evidence covered up by the U.S. government regarding extraterrestrial life to date.
, there’s far more to the story.
“RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region.” However, later that day the story mysteriously changed after a press conference stated that it wasn’t a UFO that was found, but rather a crashed weather balloon.
Many people questioned this, including Colonel Phillip Corso, Sr., who was an Army intelligence officer that served on Eisenhower’s National Security Council. Following his 21-year military career, he served as a military analyst. He made a public figure of himself by acknowledging that he personally witnessed deceased extraterrestrials from the Roswell crash.
In the following video, he discusses his initial encounter as well as having seen UFOs travel at 4,000 miles an hour on radar. He discusses how, during his employment in R&D, he was given fragments of extraterrestrial technologies from various crashes.
Corso describes the deceased aliens as having a brain completely different than that of humans. They had no nose or mouth, no digestive system, and no reproductive organs.
Although it’s still unclear as to what happened during both of these events in New Mexico, one thing’s for certain: There’s an overwhelming amount of evidence in support of UFOs.
Despite the government’s immense efforts to keep us in the dark, we are slowly but surely discovering more about UFOs and ETs.
“This thing has gotten so highly-classified… it is just impossible to get anything on it.
I have no idea who controls the flow of need-to-know because, frankly, I was told in such an emphatic way that it was none of my business that I’ve never tried to make it to be my business since.
I’m skeptical about many things, including the notion that government always knows best, and that the people can’t be trusted with the truth. The time to pull the curtain back on this subject is long overdue.
Nevertheless, thousands of documents have been released from government organizations, giving us a more in depth idea of UFOs and ET life. One document that’s particularly notable is another FBI file that specifically discusses ET life.
Part of the disks carry crews, others are under remote control.
Their mission is peaceful, the visitors contemplate settling on this planet.
These visitors are human-like but much larger in size.
The disks posses some type of radiant energy.
They do not come from any “planet” as we use the word, but from an etheric planet which interpenetrates with our own and is not perceptible to us.
The bodies of the visitors, and the craft also, automatically materialize on entering the vibratory rate of our dense matter.
They re-enter the etheric at will, and so simply disappear from our vision, without trace.
The region they come from is NOT the astral plane, but corresponds to the Lakas or Talas. Students of esoteric matters will understand these terms.
You should no longer ask yourself, “Should I believe in UFOs?” The overwhelming amount of evidence is proof enough that there’s something much greater at play here.

http://csglobe.com/biodiversity-scientist-warns-sleepwalking-mass-extinction/
ost scientists acknowledge that we are smack in the middle of the planet’s sixth great mass extinction. What they’re trying to do now is understand it, in hopes that we can stop the mechanisms that are bringing so many species to their bitter end.
On Wednesday, scientists publishing in Communications Biology characterize one of the most robust drivers of the current wave of extinction — which is, unfortunately, one that’s also extremely difficult to correct.
The problem, the University of Bath researchers write, is that we’re losing biodiversity at an alarming rate.
Biodiversity refers to the rich variation in species that live on the planet. Since all of Earth’s species are interconnected in intricate food chains, knocking out one species often means wiping out many, making it all the more important that biodiversity is preserved.
Matthew Wills, Ph.D.
released Wednesday.
By sleepwalking, he seems to be referring to the fact that we are aware of the problem but not doing anything about it.
Caridea shrimp species diversity flourish in freshwater rivers and lakes, which are most endangered by climate change.
By studying the historical fluctuations of biodiversity in a subgroup of shrimp called Caridea, the researchers witnessed just how vulnerable biodiversity can be to external factors.
This subgroup (technically an infraorder) now contains hundreds of species, but many of them have disappeared over the millennia.
Using data on the location and age of caridean fossils, the team built an evolutionary tree that showed the specific locations in which biodiversity flourished and declined over the past 200 million years.
.
If rising sea water disrupts these regions, they warn, the shrimp there could rapidly go extinct — and with them, all the species in the marine food chain that rely on them for sustenance.
What makes their conclusion especially compelling is that it’s based on documented patterns of extinction and diversity growth over millions of years and not just data collected from during the Anthropocene.
Katie Davis, Ph.D.
, in a statement.
The last mass extinction was the one that killed nearly all the dinosaurs, around 66 million years ago.
These days, when scientists talk about the current mass extinction, they’re careful to note it’s the planet’s sixth one.
By doing so they acknowledge that Earth’s history has seen such tragedies before and that we can look to historical patterns to understand what is happening now.
Studies on ancient extinctions have shown that extremely high carbon emissions are associated with widespread death, and, relatedly, so are holes in the ozone. The destruction of animal habitats by human hands is also, obviously, another driver of species death.
While it may seem alarmist to talk about the current state of the natural world in such apocalyptic terms, some scientist think that doing so is absolutely necessary.

http://csglobe.com/bill-gates-thinks-coming-disease-could-kill-30-million-people-within-6-months-were-not-ready/
We need to prepare for this like we prepare for war.
If there’s one thing that we know from history, it’s that a deadly new disease will arise and spread around the globe.
, we’re not ready.
Gates acknowledged that he’s usually the optimist in the room, reminding people that we’re lifting children out of poverty around the globe and getting better at eliminating diseases like polio and malaria.
The likelihood that such a disease will appear continues to rise.
New pathogens emerge all the time as the world population increases and humanity encroaches on wild environments. It’s becoming easier and easier for individual people or small groups to create weaponized diseases that could spread like wildfire around the globe.
in a lab.
And in our interconnected world, people are always hopping on planes, crossing from cities on one continent to those on another in a matter of hours.
Gates presented a simulation by the Institute for Disease Modelling that found that a new flu like the one that killed 50 million people in the 1918 pandemic would now most likely kill 30 million people within six months.
And the disease that next takes us by surprise is likely to be one we see for the first time at the start of an outbreak, like what happened recently with SARS and MERS viruses.
.
The one time the military tried a sort of simulated war game against a smallpox pandemic, the final score was “smallpox one, humanity zero,” Gates said.
But he reiterated that he’s an optimist, saying he thinks we could better prepare for the next viral or bacterial threat.
In some ways, we’re better prepared now than we were for previous pandemics. We have antiviral drugs that can in many cases do at least something to improve survival rates. We have antibiotics that can treat secondary infections like pneumonia associated with the flu.
We’re also getting closer to a universal flu vaccine; Gates announced on Friday that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would offer $US12 million in grants to encourage its development.
And we’re getting better at rapid diagnosis too – which is essential, as the first step toward fighting a new disease is quarantine. Just this week, a new research paper in the journal Science touted the development of a way to use the gene-editing technology Crispr to rapidly detect diseases and identify them using the same sort of paper strip used in a home pregnancy test.
But we’re not yet good enough at rapidly identifying the threat from a disease and coordinating a response, as the global reaction to the latest Ebola epidemic showed.
There needs to be better communication between militaries and governments to help coordinate responses, Gates said. And he thinks governments need ways to quickly enlist the help of the private sector when it comes to developing technology and tools to fight an emerging deadly disease.
Melinda Gates recently said that the threat of a global pandemic, whether it emerges naturally or is engineered, was perhaps the biggest risk to humanity.
“Think of the number of people who leave New York City every day and go all over the world – we’re an interconnected world,” she said.
Those connections make us all vulnerable.

http://csglobe.com/company-develops-revolutionary-create-leather-wood-bricks-mushrooms/
In a world where the average person consumes more resources than could possibly be regenerated in their lifetime, it’s no surprise to hear that our quickening resource consumption is resulting in a slow-motion collapse of the environment and all life on the planet.
However, researchers at a San Francisco Bay startup company have discovered a way to counteract this degradation.
, a company which creates products out of fungi, believes that the answer may lie in replacing just some of the many products we consume with this entirely sustainable and renewable source material.
The company currently has the ability to create material which is similar to animal skin, but even sturdier than leather.
They were able to create products which are more durable than deer skin in only a matter of months, but what is perhaps most encouraging about the project is that the material only takes two weeks to create, whereas real leather takes about two years for animal to be ready, without considering the costs of feed and housing.
, paper waste, saw dust, and corn cobs.
By feeding mushrooms particular things that they like, as well as managing temperature and light exposure, these scientists are able to create various breathable materials which theoretically could replace cloth, leather, and even wood and brick.
Not only is the material extremely durable and strong, but it is a highly competent flame retardant as well. Even when subjected to extremely hot flames, the fungus material stays intact and is immediately self-extinguishing.
The combination of high-quality material and ease of production could make it an extremely desirable product for all types of consumers.
Being more resilient than brick and less flammable than wood, this material would naturally work well for building. Eventually, Philip and other scientists believe that it will be possible to produce smartphones, solar panels, and a whole plethora of other products from waste material and mushrooms.
This new material could go hand in hand with other environmentally friendly materials like hemp. If hemp and mushrooms were used together to create fuel, cloth, building materials, leather, and plastics, there would almost no longer be a need for concern over environmental damage or a lack of sustainability.
in a short YouTube video.
Theoretically, you could start building your own products from mushrooms right away. It’s even possible to embed intricate colors and patterns directly into the material if you know how.
and continues to reach thousands of people with their message.
With enough demand for locally-produced and sustainable materials, the future of consumer goods could turn from an environmental blight back into a sustainable way we can move forward into the future.

http://csglobe.com/oklahoma-high-schoolers-carbon-discovery-elicits-wonder/
Taking teenage rebellion to a new level, Oklahoma high school senior George Wang stunned teachers and fellow students when in April he co-authored a chemistry paper up-ending a long-held belief about carbon, a fundamental element of life.
In his Journal of Molecular Modeling paper, Wang and his two mentors showed that carbon, long thought to be only capable of forming four bonds, can actually form seven.
In publishing this unprecedented work, Wang joins a community of theoretical chemists who explain to Inverse that the discovery is far more than a mere scientific achievement.
Among the scientists who reviewed Wang’s work before it was published in the journal was Joel Liebman, Ph.D., a professor of chemistry at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC).
The names and affiliations on the paper, which also included Wang’s high school chemistry professor at the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, Dr. A.K. Fazlur Rahman, and University of Oklahoma chemist Bin Wang, Ph.D., weren’t familiar to Liebman, who only found out that George was in high school when Inverse wrote to him in late April.
“To find out a high school student was involved, I think the most remarkable thing about it is the degree of encouragement that the student got,” says Liebman.
Take any introductory chemistry course and you’re guaranteed to learn that carbon, by nature of the number of electrons circling its nucleus, is capable of forming four bonds with other elements, forming basic organic chemicals like carbon dioxide, ethanol, and methane.
Under very rare circumstances, however, an unusual form of carbon called a “hypercarbon” can occur, and this can, theoretically, form more than four bonds.
that it could form six. Wang’s work, showing that seven bonds are theoretically possible, wowed even Moritz Malischewski, Ph.D., of the Free University of Berlin, who co-authored the 2016 paper.
Wang did the work on his own after being challenged by Rahman, an organic chemist by training, during a high school chemistry lesson. “I asked the students, is it possible that it can make more than six?” Rahman, who presented Malischewski’s paper as a springboard, told Inverse in a previous interview.
, which he’d learned to use with the help of a mentor and online manuals, and presented his calculations to Rahman.
With the help of Bin Wang, a physical chemist, the team got the paper published in a peer-reviewed international journal. George, who was a junior at the time he made the calculations, got top billing on the paper.
Mentors like Rahman (left) are rare, says Liebman.
, meant to protest the lack of funding and resources available to teachers.
“We have congressmen, senators, who don’t believe in science,” Rahman told Inverse, explaining that Wang’s example underscored the need for better support for teachers, who students in turn rely on for intellectual support.
Liebman, a chemist whose career stretches back to the 1970s, emphatically supports the need for better mentorship in the sciences. “Good mentoring is rather rare,” he says, applauding Rahman’s role in Wang’s work.
“To have someone who is not threatened but is rather encouraging — that is rather rare.” Noting that the field of chemistry is traditionally “international and intercultural,” he is encouraged that Wang and Rahman, by building on the work of the German team and George Andrew Olah, Ph.D., the Nobel Prize-winning chemist that pioneered hypercarbon chemistry, are continuing that legacy.
Arguably, the most important effect of Rahman’s mentorship is not that Wang found the answer to the daring question posed in his high school class but that Wang was encouraged to pursue research that is by nature rebellious.
Theoretical chemistry — and the discipline of science as a whole — is built on the exploration of the unknown and the unimaginable. Perhaps Wang’s willingness to do so can be chalked up to his youth; maybe it’s just that he isn’t as well acquainted with the “rules” of chemistry just yet.
Whatever the case, his story illustrates why creativity is so highly valued in the field. “It is important that theoretical chemists propose interesting but hard-to-reach molecules and maybe, one day, they will be synthesized in the lab,” says Malischewski.

http://csglobe.com/exxon-suncor-sued-stoking-climate-change/
Coastal cities like New York and San Francisco have already started legal battles with oil giants for knowingly fueling climate change.
and Suncor, both of which extract large amounts of oil and gas from the Colorado ground.
These climate alterations, they argue, have brought increased heatwaves, droughts, and fire to the region. They believe Exxon and Suncor should pay for the damages.
Previously, lawsuits from coastal cities focused on sea level rise, not the other extreme manifestations of global warming.
This is the first such climate lawsuit from an inland state, according to the local agencies which filed the complaint.
“A few pebbles are turning into a landslide,” Kassie Siegel, director of the Climate Law Institute, a legal campaign to protect environments from climate change, said in an interview.
in 1968.
The report will likely serve as important evidence in the case, should the trial proceed and not be settled out of court or be derailed by a number of legal circumstances.
“I would expect that report and others like it would be key evidence in this case,” said Siegel.
, like solar.
“Communities in Colorado and across the country are already doing what they can to curb their carbon emissions and are spending millions of dollars to adapt to a wide array of harms caused by global warming,” Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement.
“Those costs will only multiply over the next few decades, and taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to foot the bill that the fossil fuel industry has knowingly run up over the last 40 years.” The Union of Concerned Scientists is a nonprofit science advocacy organization that often speaks out against climate change deniers.
In the western United States, one obvious consequence of increased drought and heat are wildfires.
— similar to California.
and Suncor sell oil in Colorado. Suncor has an especially prominent presence, as the company runs its operations out of Denver, a city currently facing drought. Suncor sends over 200 truckloads of Colorado crude oil to its refineries each day.
Last month, some of the nation’s largest oil companies presented their understanding of climate science to a federal judge in San Francisco, in which they admitted humans were contributing to climate change, but side-stepped responsibility.
These proceedings move incrementally, so it’s not yet known if that hearing will advance to the next step, and then, potentially a trial.
But oil companies are now being hit with lawsuits from local governments on both coasts and the interior of the U.S.

http://csglobe.com/genetic-tests-reveal-tragic-reality-ata-alien-skeleton/
When the mummified remains of a six-inch humanoid were found in an abandoned mining town in Chile’s Atacama desert 15 years ago, speculation on its origins ran wild.
as potential evidence for alien life.
Now scientists in California have extracted DNA from the mummy’s bones and pieced together the real and tragic story of the individual, known as Ata.
Rather than a visitor from another world, Ata was a girl who appears to have been stillborn, or to have died immediately after birth, with devastating mutations that shaped her extraordinary body.
Ata’s remains were found in 2003 in La Noria, an old nitrate-mining town, reportedly wrapped in white cloth tied with a violet ribbon.
The skeleton was remarkable in many ways. While only six inches tall, the bones had some features of a child aged six to eight. Instead of the usual 12 pairs of ribs found on humans, Ata had only 10 pairs. The head was an elongated cone shape.
, but the reasons for the dramatic deformities were far from clear.
Nolan and his colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco have now published their analysis of Ata’s full genetic makeup.
From DNA extracted from the bones, they found that Ata was a girl who carried mutations in at least seven genes that are known to cause major skeletal malformations or accelerate their development.
Taken together they explain Ata’s size, abnormal ribs and skull shape, and the apparently advanced age of her bones.
Beyond her skeletal malformations, Ata may have had a condition called congenital diaphragmatic hernia, a relatively common life-threatening birth defect in which the diaphragm does not develop properly. Further analysis found that Ata’s DNA most closely resembled that of other Chileans.
.
Nolan believes that Ata was stillborn or died immediately after her birth, perhaps 40 years before her remains were discovered. “She was so badly malformed as to be unable to feed. In her condition, she would have ended up in the neonatal ICU, but given where the specimen was found, such things were simply not available,” he said.

http://csglobe.com/navy-keeps-encountering-mysterious-ufos/
Despite numerous reports, the military has not put any significant or serious effort into finding out specific explanations for UFO incidents.
One of the reasons why there has not been a serious effort is because there is a negative stigma associated with those who believe that the UFOs may be visitors from beyond Earth.
in an interview in December 2017.
Fravor was describing his encounter with an unidentified flying object during a training mission off the coast of California on November 14, 2004. The UFO was performing seemingly impossible moves — “left, right, forward, back, just random,” in Fravor ‘s words, and then accelerated and disappeared.
“I have never seen anything in my life, in my history of flying that has the performance, the acceleration — keep in mind this thing had no wings,” he said.
in December by the New York Times. The second video shows US Navy pilots tracking one of apparently numerous UFOs moving at high speeds with seemingly no source of propulsion.
“This is a f—— drone bro,” one pilot says. “There’s a whole fleet of them. Look on the S.A.” the other responds.
Soon, to the shock of the pilots, the UFO changes position. “Look at that thing!” one calls out as the UFO, somehow manages to turn on its side while still maintaining its speed and direction. “Its rotating!” the other pilot says.
Another video posted online last Friday by the To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, a private scientific research group, shows a similar incident — a US Navy F/A-18 getting a lock on a UFO, and the crew yelling their excitement and confusion at each other.
“Whoa! Got it!” one of the pilots, yells after getting a lock. “What the f— is that thing?!” the other asks.
These videos are a select few of a number of recorded encounters between the US Navy and UFO’s that the Department of Defense has unclassified and released.
to give an in-depth analysis on each event that the DoD has released.
The DoD has not identified any of the mystery aircraft, leading some to believe that they could be extraterrestrial technology manned by alien visitors.
The DoD did have a program dedicated to investigating UFO incidents that was started in 2007, but the department terminated the funding for the project in 2012. Though the Times reports that some defense and intelligence officials are still investigating the incidents, they appear to have made virtually no progress in coming to a conclusion or any findings.
There is reportedly a negative stigma associated with anyone who pursues the idea that the UFOs are extraterrestrial life visiting earth and believers tend to attribute the slow progress on identifying the aircraft on lack of interest from superiors.
.
As a result, he claims, the military does virtually nothing with the numerous reports of UFOs that servicemen make.
“There is no Pentagon process for synthesizing all the observations the military is making. The current approach is equivalent to having the Army conduct a submarine search without the Navy,” Mellon writes.
Mellon argues that the issue needs to be taken seriously, and that a concerted effort that cuts through the “quarrelsome national security bureaucracies” could find realistic explanations for the incidents, and not rule out alien life as purely fictional.
Robert Bigelow, an American billionaire who works with NASA, is likewise convinced that aliens exist and that UFOs have visited Earth.
Countries like China, Russia, and other European nations are willing to pursue this idea more than their American counterparts, according to Bigelow.
“They are proactive and willing to discuss this topic, rather than being held back by a juvenile taboo,” he said.

A new report reveals that the formerly pro-GMO Chinese government, one of the largest consumers of GMO food crops in the world, is beginning to crack down on GM corn shipments from the US that have not followed appropriate biosafety regulations.
According to a news brief released today by GMWatch.org, China destroyed three shipments of GM corn imported from the US.

They revealed that “48.1% of articles were largely supportive of the GM technology research and development programs and the adoption of GM cottons, while 51.9% of articles were neutral on the subject of GMOs. Risks associated with GMOs were mentioned in the newspaper articles, but none of the articles expressed negative tones in regards to GMOs.

,” is suing the school district for discrimination.
According to the federal lawsuit, Stacy Bailey believes the Mansfield Independent School District put her on paid administrative leave, then offered to transfer her to a secondary school, because she is gay.
“Stacy Bailey wants Mansfield to admit what they did was wrong,” said her attorney, Jason Smith during a news conference in Dallas on Tuesday.
Parents complained after Bailey introduced herself to her class at Charlotte Anderson Elementary School in Arlington, Texas, with a slideshow of her friends and family, including a picture with her wife, who was then her fiancée, according to the lawsuit.
She was put on leave after she mentioned a male artist who had a male partner, said the suit.
“We’ve been in disbelief, we’ve been shocked, we’ve been hurt deeply,” said Julie Vasquez, Bailey’s wife.
“She was treated differently than heterosexual couples who show their significant others,” Smith said.
The statement continued, “Mrs. Bailey has been a teacher with Mansfield (Independent School District) for a decade. During her tenure with the District, there has never been an issue with her open sexual preferences until this year.
At a board meeting last month, dozens of parents, teachers, students and community members on both sides of the issue spoke passionately about her case.
The district ultimately decided to renew Bailey’s contract, but she still isn’t back in the classroom.
They offered to transfer her to a secondary school, but she thinks that sends the wrong message.
“It sends the message that lesbians and gays can’t teach elementary students, that’s why it’s wrong,” Smith said.
Vasquez said her wife, isn’t just fighting for herself. She said, she wants to set a precedent and get specific protections for the LGBTQ community added in the school’s anti-discrimination policy.

http://csglobe.com/alien-megastructure-acting-weird-again/
For some people, the weird lights emanating from the ‘alien megastructure ’ 1,280 light-years away from Earth are bursts of alien energy built by an advanced civilization to harvest power.
For the non-conspiratorial, it’s just a collection of cosmic dust passing in front of a star to produce a light show.
Whatever it is, the alien megastructure has just started acting up again and has dimmed by 5%, making it the faintest it’s ever been since observed by Kepler in 2013.
of its usual brightness yesterday.
It’s not actually unusual for stars to dim. In fact, it is Kepler’s job to look for dimming stars since it’s what often signifies the existence of an exoplanet.
The strange thing with Tabby’s Star, however, is that the dimming isn’t regularly occurring, something evidenced by the massive 22% brightening and dimming of the star back in 2013.
Combine that with the erratic nature of the dimming, and scientists are faced with one unusual space phenomenon.
So what’s going on? Are the aliens heading off? While astrophysicists have no idea what’s leading to KIC 8462852’s light dim, they’re pretty certain we can rule out a bunch of nefarious aliens.
theory.
With observatory time, Boyajian and her team were able analyse the star’s erratic light shifts and spectrum, and observe how the light was being blocked at differing intensities.
“Dust is most likely the reason why the star’s light appears to dim and brighten,” Boyajian explained.
That doesn’t mean the case is closed, however. We still don’t know where any of this cosmic dust is coming from, or in fact why it’s behaving in such a random way. Alien megastructure or not, Tabby’s Star just isn’t behaving as expected, and this sudden dim is only adding to its complete air of mystery.

http://csglobe.com/alien-obsessed-student-disappears/
A UFO enthusiast who mysteriously vanished last week left behind a den plastered wall-to-wall with Illuminati codes and symbols.
The psychology student, Bruno Borges, 24, disappeared from his home in Rio Branco in the west of Brazil having spent the past month working on what is being described as a secret project.
statue of 16th-century philosopher Giordano Bruno who predicted alien life, 14 encrypted books and signs associated with the Illuminati spread across the floor.
He has not been seen since March 27, and his father told local press he was last seen in a t-shirt and a pair of shorts and would have had no money nor documents.
Deputy Fabrizzio Sobreira, coordinator of the Criminal Investigation Office (DIC), who is leading the investigations, confirmed to the newspaper Acre TV all possibilities are being considered amid speculation he was abducted by the aliens he obsesses over.
The psychology student went missing shortly after his parents returned from a month-long trip, during which he stayed at home with his sister furiously beavering away at his project.
When his parents left, his bedroom was said to be normal, but 25 days later they were covered in coded writing and symbols as well as 14 secret manuscripts, each with a different Roman numeral on the cover.

http://csglobe.com/ikea-designs-pre-made-tiny-homes-to-send-to-refugee-camps-around-the-world/
IKEA recently announced plans to send 10,000 out-of-the-box-ready refugee shelters to people in need around the world.
Working with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, IKEA’s foundation called Better Shelter will be providing more sustainable homes for struggling nations around the world.
Testing these refugee homes began back in 2013 in places like Lebanon and Iraq. After having successful results, IKEA and UNHCR will finally be able to deliver large numbers of these homes to refugee camps across the globe.
Each home costs approximately $1000 and could revolutionize the lives of thousands of people who are driven into refugee housing situations.
These effective shelters are designed to last years if necessary, replacing what was once inadequate housing with an expiry date of a few months.
Each unit, inspired by IKEA’s standard easy-to-make reputation, is practically ready as soon as it arrives, with minimal assembly and absolutely no tools required.
A new home can be easily put together in less than four hours with the help of simple illustrated instructions.
The home consists of polymer panels connected to a steel frame, with aluminum-mesh roofing that’s designed to keep the home at a comfortable cool temperature during the day while also trapping the warmth in at night.
With 188 square feet, each unit comfortably fits a family a five—comfortable meaning that each person can have their own bed. There is also access to solar power, mosquito nets, lights, and ventilation in each home.
In order to help people in any circumstance, IKEA’s design for the refugee home can be used in climates around the world including withstanding extreme heat and the bitter cold.
offer people a reasonable shelter from harsh weather conditions, they allow access to solar power, mosquito nets, lights and ventilation—resources that many people would otherwise never receive.
These homes provide refugee communities with reliable shelters and can lift a major weight off the shoulders of families, giving many the opportunity to rebuild a stronger, sustainable and more productive society.

http://csglobe.com/israel-iran-engage-most-serious-confrontation-syria/
Israeli forces unleashed a heavy bombardment against Iranian military installations in Syria on Thursday in what Israel called retaliation for an Iranian rocket barrage on its positions in the occupied Golan Heights, the most serious military confrontation between the two bitter enemies to date.
The two rivals have long fought each other through proxies, and with the new exchange each seemed to be sending a warning that a direct clash between them could swiftly escalate.
“If we get rain, they’ll get a flood,” Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman warned.
The scope of the attacks — which Israel called its largest in Syria since the 1973 Mideast war — raised the specter of a full-fledged war between Iran and Israel in Syria, a conflict that could potentially drag the militant Hezbollah and Lebanon into the mix with devastating effects, although both sides appeared to signal they wanted the confrontation to remain contained, at least for now.
earlier this week, and the latest escalation seemed to signal a potentially coordinated surge in military activity targeting Iran.
The Israeli military said Thursday it hit nearly all of Iran’s military installations in Syria in response to the overnight Iranian rocket barrage that targeted Israeli front-line military positions in the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. It was the first time Israel has directly accused Iran of firing toward Israeli territory.
Iranian media described the Israeli attack as “unprecedented,” but there was no official Iranian comment on Israel’s claims.
. But it seemed to carefully calibrate its response by targeting the Golan Heights, which Israel annexed in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognized, instead of striking Israel proper.
Tehran is wary of a wider military conflagration with Israel that could jeopardize its military achievements in Syria at a time when it is trying to salvage the international nuclear deal and may be limited in its ability to strike back.
The recent clashes reveal the difficulty both sides face in dealing with an unprecedented situation, said Jean-Pierre Filiu, a professor of Middle East studies at Sciences Po, Paris School of International Affairs.
The clashes will eventually likely lead not to further escalation, but to the “consolidation of new ‘red lines’ tacitly endorsed by Israel and Iran,” he said in an analysis written for the Carnegie Middle East Center.
The extent of the damage inflicted by the Israeli airstrikes was not immediately clear.
Israel said among the targets were weapons storage, logistics sites and intelligence centers used by elite Iranian forces in Syria. It also said it destroyed several Syrian air-defense systems after coming under heavy fire and that none of its warplanes were hit.
The Syrian military acknowledged that the strikes destroyed a radar station and an ammunition warehouse, and damaged a number of air defense units. It said three people were killed and two were wounded.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which closely monitors the civil war through sources inside Syria, said 23 fighters, including five Syrian soldiers, were killed. It was not immediately clear if any Iranians were among the dead.
The White House swiftly condemned Iran’s “provocative rocket attacks from Syria against Israeli citizens” and expressed strong support for “Israel’s right to act in self-defense,” while Russia said the Israeli strikes marked a dangerous escalation and urged both Israel and Iran to avoid provoking each other.
Israel has carried out over 100 airstrikes in neighboring Syria since the civil war erupted in 2011, most believed to be aimed at suspected Iranian weapons shipments bound for the Hezbollah militant group.
But in the past few weeks, Israel has shifted to a more direct and public confrontation with Iran, striking at Iranian bases, weapons depots and rocket launchers across Syria, and killing Iranian troops. Israel accuses Tehran of seeking to establish a foothold on its doorstep, something it has vowed never to allow.
Reflecting the scope of the pre-dawn attack, Russia’s military said 28 Israeli jets were involved, striking Iranian and government sites in Syria with 70 missiles. It said half the missiles were shot down.
Speaking at the Herzliya Conference, an annual security gathering north of Tel Aviv, Lieberman said Israel would respond fiercely to any further Iranian actions.
Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 war and annexed it in 1981. In 1974, Israel and Syria reached a cease-fire and a disengagement deal that froze the conflict lines with the plateau in Israeli hands.
Damascus shook with sounds of explosions just before dawn, and firing by Syrian air defenses over the city was heard for more than five hours.
Russia sent forces to Syria to back President Bashar Assad in 2015. But Israel and Russia have maintained close communications to prevent their air forces from coming into conflict. The pan-Arab Al Hayat newspaper reported Thursday that Russia and Israel were developing an agreement to keep Iran out of southern Syria and allow Syrian government forces to retake the region.
Israel said early Thursday that Iran’s Quds Force fired 20 rockets at Israeli front-line military positions in the Golan Heights. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said four of the rockets were intercepted, while the others fell short of their targets. The incoming attack set off air raid sirens in the Golan.
“Should there be another Iranian attack, we will be prepared for it,” he said.
The two sides have been on a collision course for months.
In February, Israel shot down what it said was an armed Iranian drone that entered Israeli airspace. Israel responded by attacking anti-aircraft positions in Syria, and an Israeli warplane was shot down during the battle.
Earlier this week, Syrian state media said Israel struck a military outpost near Damascus. The Observatory said the missiles targeted depots and rocket launchers that likely belonged to Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard, killing at least 15 people, including eight Iranians.
Last month, an attack on Syria’s T4 air base in the central Homs province killed seven Iranian military personnel.

http://csglobe.com/mystery-stingray-devices-discovered-washington/
Spy kits that can track mobile phones and intercept calls and messages have been discovered in Washington and beyond, the US government has said.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says it has observed “anomalous activity” consistent with the use of so-called stingrays.
They could be used by foreign spies or criminals, although the DHS said it did not know who was using them.
It added that such devices pose a “growing risk”.
Stingrays, a brand name for a type of International Mobile Subscriber Identity catcher (IMSI), are mobile phone surveillance devices that mimic mobile phone towers.
The size of a briefcase, the devices send out signals to trick mobile phones into transmitting their location and identifying information.
As well as tracking the mobile phone of a suspect, the devices also gather information about phones of bystanders who are nearby.
in Washington.
The revelation came in response to a letter from US senator Ron Wyden to the DHS, asking about the unauthorised use of such devices.
from Wyden’s office.
In it, a senior official at the DHS acknowledged that it had “observed anomalous activity in the National Capital Region (NCR) that appears to be consistent with International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers”.
The use of Stingray devices by police forces across the US is being tracked by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). It has identified 73 agencies in 25 states that own such devices but believes there could be many more in use which are not formally declared.
There are concerns among politicians in Washington that such devices could also be used by unauthorized agencies, such as foreign governments.

http://csglobe.com/with-this-greenhouse-it-is-now-possible-to-grow-crops-in-the-desert/
has designed a greenhouse that collects moisture from the air, which then is used to water the plants.
This greenhouse has multifunctional purpose: grow food and produce water.
This new design can help farmers in areas where the lack of proper temperature and rainfall make it difficult to grow crops.
Inside, the hot air is trapped so the temperature in the greenhouse keeps rising throughout the day.
The heat causes water to evaporate, creating air humidity making the greenhouse atmosphere better for plants’ growth as well as maximizing the dew harvest.
When the surface temperature drops at evening until morning, the farmer pulls out the rope to open the top of the greenhouse allowing it to cool, eventually reaching the dew point, atmospheric water vapor condenses to form small droplets on the surface of the bio-plastic sheet falling into the water tank container.
This system allows farmers to harvest water used as safe drinking water and irrigation.
Roots Up plans to launch the project in areas of Ethiopia, where droughts are common and farming is difficult.

http://csglobe.com/uk-government-secret-ufo-sighting-files/
It’s official: Britain has announced that it will be releasing previously classified information on UFO sightings in the United Kingdom once the general election is over this June.
, a “news blog on frontier science and the paranormal” that received the exclusive story, the government is expected to release formerly unpublished reports on UFO activity collected over the span of 50 years by the British Ministry of Defence (MoD).
This event has been greatly anticipated, especially since the announcement in 2014 when the MoD admitted to holding back 18 documents because some content needed to be “re-examined” before the organization could officially make it accessible to the public.
of its information on UFO sightings via the National Archives and under the Freedom of Information Act, which we now know was a lie.
and are dated from 1971-1976 and 1996-2000.
Others are predicting that some of the files will be in relation to the “Rendlesham Forest Incident,” Britain’s most famous UFO sighting in 1980, located at military RAF-bases Bentwaters and Woodbridge.
The United States Air Force was stationed in Suffolk, England, when a mystery triangle craft landed and was seen up close by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and at least one other witness.
.
It seems to me that the Bentwaters incident is a classic case where an apparent intrusion into our airspace and indeed a landing in our country was witnessed by serious-minded people in the military, responsible people doing a responsible job, and Bentwaters is in a sense, a benchmark of how not to deal with these matters in the future.
I know a good bit about the Bentwaters incident . . . [and] there are only two explanations for what happened that night in Suffolk.
The first is that what the people concerned . . . claim [is] that something from outside the Earth’s atmosphere landed at their Air Force base, they went and stood by it, they inspected it, they photographed it, the following day they took tests on the ground where it had been and found radioactive traces. They reported this . . . and sent it to our Ministry of Defense.
here is a serious possibility that we are being visited and have been visited for many years by people from outer space, from other civilizations.
That it behooves us, in case some of these people in the future or now should turn hostile, to find out who they are, where they come from, and what they want. This should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation and not the subject of ‘rubishing’ by tabloid newspapers.
Let’s hope that the documents from the UK actually get published this time! The MoD announced it would release these same files in 2015, then it got pushed to 2016, and then it got extended to summer 2016, then March 2017, and now it’s June.
The current delay is apparently tje result of the general election, but either way, it’s clear that there’s a serious lack of transparency.

may be one of the most toxic foods in the world.
As a result of overcrowding, disease, pollution and low quality fish-meal, the resulting salmon meat is often contaminated and can lack the valuable nutrients of wild-caught salmon.
Worldwide, due to growing awareness of the environmental and health impacts of red meat, people have begun to favor white meat and fish.
As a result, the aquaculture industry is suffering from the growing pains of high demand, and subsequently has been accused of procedures seriously compromising fish-meat quality.
One of the biggest threats facing fisheries today is the alarming epidemic of parasitic sea lice. Lice attach to fish and drain their blood.
Just a few lice are capable of killing a full grown salmon, and unless the carcass is removed, it will decompose and subsequently contaminate live fish. Often, sea lice propagated in crowded, open-net fisheries spread to infect and kill wild salmon.

Some fisheries have begin to introduce cleaner fish, which feed on sea lice and offer a biological solution to reducing lice outbreaks.

Natural doesn't always mean better, though.
ature is full of drugs. For various reasons, evolutionary forces have led certain plants, fungi, and even animals to develop molecules that interact with the human brain.
And while it’s not too hard to get your hands on synthetic psychedelic drugs like LSD or MDMA, many people prefer natural alternatives.
Of course, just because something is natural doesn’t mean that it’s safer or more effective.
After all, the natural world is home to incredibly toxic chemicals, so don’t think a drug is safer or better just because something comes from the Earth.
though they might not all be particularly pleasant or safe to consume.
And just to be clear, CSGlobe is providing this information so you can do further research on these drugs and decide whether they are right for you.
Without further ado, here’s the list of top five natural, legal psychedelics, in order from most unpleasant to least unpleasant.
” or “deli bal,” which derives its unique properties from the flowers that the bees feed on.
Rhododendron flowers contain a handful of neurotoxins called grayanotoxins, and these substances pass through the bees into the honey they produce. It’s totally legal and pretty easy to buy online, though it’s often pricey.
Effects of mad honey can vary from a mild inebriation to full-on paralysis and potentially death.
While low doses — about one tablespoon — are considered safe, the members of the Erowid community, a group well-known for experimentation, recommend avoiding rhododendron components altogether. This is the only item on the list we’d advise against.
It’s not as potent, and users report that the experience is usually not as lucid. While LSA can induce profound visual hallucinations, the experience can also come with a lot of physical discomfort like nausea, cramping, and vomiting, making it undesirable for many people.
The seeds are legal in the U.S., but if you’re going to ingest them, make sure to get them from a retailer that intends them for human consumption, as garden stores often sell seeds treated with pesticides that can make you sick. And as with any new substance, start with a low dose, and never do it alone.
“, you probably think of the psilocybin-containing ones, but Amanita muscaria mushrooms, commonly known as fly agaric mushrooms, have a long history of human use in Europe, Asia, and North America.
Often classified as poisonous, fly agaric mushrooms are safe in low doses, especially if they’re dried thoroughly.
Like other psychedelics, effects include visual hallucinations and altered perception, as well as a huge range of mental effects that depend on the user. Negative side effects can include nausea, cramps, and delirium at high doses.
They’re legal in most places, and they even grow in the U.S., but if you plan on foraging them in the wild, make sure you consult a field guide and bring someone who knows what they’re doing.
— common name Sonoran Desert toad or Colorado River toad — secretes a potent hallucinogenic compound from glands on either side of its head.
While this secretion can make potential predators confused or ill if they try to eat the toad, humans who dry and smoke the compound get a short-lived but intense psychedelic experience thanks to the potent chemicals 5-MeO-DMT and bufotenin.
While 5-MeO-DMT is classified as a Schedule I drug, the strictest category of illegality, the toad itself is not controlled. So if you live in Mexico or the southwestern U.S., you can milk toad glands to get high. Just don’t get caught with the gland secretions.
Last but definitely not least is the class of cacti that contain mescaline, a psychedelic with thousands of years of human use.
) is most famously found in peyote, a cactus that is illegal for most people in the U.S. to possess, purchase, or consume — the small exception is members of the Native American Church.
It tops the list because a decent number of mescaline-containing cacti are legal in the U.S., including Peruvian torch (Echinopsis peruvianus), San Pedro (Echinopsis pachanoi), and Bolivian torch (Echinopsis lageniformis).
These cacti are easy to grow, meaning you can plant your own and cut pieces off every now and then. They’re also easy to cut up and blend into a psychedelic smoothie — once you remove the spines and core, of course.
Mescaline induces a mental state that many users find pleasant and manageable, though as with any psychedelic, those results can vary greatly depending on your physical setting and psychological state.
As with many of the drugs on this list, side effects include nausea and potential vomiting.

http://csglobe.com/played-system-time-new-paradigm/
People are waking up in droves, but the majority continue to be played by the system, unaware that almost every subject under the sun is rigged: In effect we are confined to living in a false or limiting paradigm.
Corporate/Banker sponsored pseudo-science has had a grip on humanity for quite some time, headed by highly dogmatic fake guru scientists.
that these so-called Gurus are fake and wrong; they may look at you as if you have 3 heads, no matter how knowledgeable you are or good at communicating the real science.
Indeed, the awakened know that regardless of who’s in power all the major political party leaders are only puppets to the ruling elite puppet masters. Thus, the ruling elite make all the major political decisions regardless of who’s in power, making the parties and their leaders irrelevant.
The masses are distracted from waking up to the realization of this: For instance, one of the latest tricks used to con the masses into giving their support has been to make the leader of a political party look like an ‘outsider’ who will not walk the dictated political white line.
Sadly, the majority are still falling for the fake wars narratives with their related psyops; false flags or divide and rule tactics, pushed on us for the ulterior motives of power, profit and political gains.
The warmongers, aided and abetted by the mainstream media threaten the existence of not only every man, woman and child, but all life forms on this planet if nuclear war breaks out.
As part of the deception, to get approval, the ruling elite present their agendas as ‘beneficial’ when, in fact, they are actually harmful or enslaving to the masses.
The greater the difference between something that is perceived by the masses as ‘beneficial’ compared to the opposite of what it really is, the easier the elite can advance their agendas.
.
One of the tricks used to cover-up information and allow hidden crooked agendas to continue is to put the masses into a state of confusion or neutrality.
For example, through Big Pharma shills with their disinformation and/or the cover-up of scientific evidence in the elite’s owned and controlled mainstream media, the masses have been duped into confusion, not knowing what to do regarding choices on life-saving alternative health practices.
Ruled and divided, wilfully ignorant and apathetic to the woes of the world, some people love their comfort zone so much they will do all they can to remain there. To avoid confrontation, they go into agreement with the general consensus of the masses while blindly accepting the rule of authority without ever questioning.
Labelled as Stockholm Syndrome, some people even love and defend their servitude under the rule of authority.
Disconnect from the imprisoning control system.
Disconnect from giving your support to those power-drunk, dishonest, egomaniacal puppet politicians.
internet of things.
Stop using ‘smart’ technology (dumb technology).
Disconnect from consuming disease-causing food and water poisoned with GMO technology, toxic ingredients and additives, irradiated by nutrient-nuking manufacturing processes… Refuse toxic medicines such as vaccines.
Disconnect from the greed-driven mega-corporations swallowing up small businesses while depriving the freedom of their owners in the monopolies. Support the small business man.

Besides making the effort to disconnect from the ruling Elite’s control system, to stop us from being dictated, we also need to change our ways by reconnecting with our true self.

http://csglobe.com/serious-mistake-barack-obamas-statement-president-trumps-decision-iran-nuclear-deal/
Former President Barack Obama criticized President Donald Trump’s decision Tuesday to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal.
campaign promise.
The 2015 pact lifted sanctions on Iran that crippled its economy and cut its oil exports roughly in half.
In exchange for sanctions relief, Iran accepted limits on its nuclear program and allowed international inspectors into its facilities.
Pulling out of the deal could strain diplomatic relationships with U.S. allies such as France and Germany, and it could have ripple effects in the oil market.
at risk without any Iranian violation of the deal is a serious mistake,” Obama.
“There are few issues more important to the security of the United States than the potential spread of nuclear weapons, or the potential for even more destructive war in the Middle East. That’s why the United States negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in the first place.
The reality is clear. The JCPOA is working – that is a view shared by our European allies, independent experts, and the current U.S. Secretary of Defense. The JCPOA is in America’s interest – it has significantly rolled back Iran’s nuclear program. And the JCPOA is a model for what diplomacy can accomplish – its inspections and verification regime is precisely what the United States should be working to put in place with North Korea. Indeed, at a time when we are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from the JCPOA risks losing a deal that accomplishes – with Iran – the very outcome that we are pursuing with the North Koreans.
That is why today’s announcement is so misguided. Walking away from the JCPOA turns our back on America’s closest allies, and an agreement that our country’s leading diplomats, scientists, and intelligence professionals negotiated. In a democracy, there will always be changes in policies and priorities from one Administration to the next. But the consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America’s credibility, and puts us at odds with the world’s major powers.
Debates in our country should be informed by facts, especially debates that have proven to be divisive. So it’s important to review several facts about the JCPOA.
First, the JCPOA was not just an agreement between my Administration and the Iranian government. After years of building an international coalition that could impose crippling sanctions on Iran, we reached the JCPOA together with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the European Union, Russia, China, and Iran. It is a multilateral arms control deal, unanimously endorsed by a United Nations Security Council Resolution.
Second, the JCPOA has worked in rolling back Iran’s nuclear program. For decades, Iran had steadily advanced its nuclear program, approaching the point where they could rapidly produce enough fissile material to build a bomb. The JCPOA put a lid on that breakout capacity. Since the JCPOA was implemented, Iran has destroyed the core of a reactor that could have produced weapons-grade plutonium; removed two-thirds of its centrifuges (over 13,000) and placed them under international monitoring; and eliminated 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium – the raw materials necessary for a bomb. So by any measure, the JCPOA has imposed strict limitations on Iran’s nuclear program and achieved real results.
Third, the JCPOA does not rely on trust – it is rooted in the most far-reaching inspections and verification regime ever negotiated in an arms control deal. Iran’s nuclear facilities are strictly monitored. International monitors also have access to Iran’s entire nuclear supply chain, so that we can catch them if they cheat. Without the JCPOA, this monitoring and inspections regime would go away.
Fourth, Iran is complying with the JCPOA. That was not simply the view of my Administration. The United States intelligence community has continued to find that Iran is meeting its responsibilities under the deal, and has reported as much to Congress. So have our closest allies, and the international agency responsible for verifying Iranian compliance – the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Fifth, the JCPOA does not expire. The prohibition on Iran ever obtaining a nuclear weapon is permanent. Some of the most important and intrusive inspections codified by the JCPOA are permanent. Even as some of the provisions in the JCPOA do become less strict with time, this won’t happen until ten, fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years into the deal, so there is little reason to put those restrictions at risk today.
Finally, the JCPOA was never intended to solve all of our problems with Iran. We were clear-eyed that Iran engages in destabilizing behavior – including support for terrorism, and threats toward Israel and its neighbors. But that’s precisely why it was so important that we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Every aspect of Iranian behavior that is troubling is far more dangerous if their nuclear program is unconstrained. Our ability to confront Iran’s destabilizing behavior – and to sustain a unity of purpose with our allies – is strengthened with the JCPOA, and weakened without it.
Because of these facts, I believe that the decision to put the JCPOA at risk without any Iranian violation of the deal is a serious mistake. Without the JCPOA, the United States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East. We all know the dangers of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. It could embolden an already dangerous regime; threaten our friends with destruction; pose unacceptable dangers to America’s own security; and trigger an arms race in the world’s most dangerous region. If the constraints on Iran’s nuclear program under the JCPOA are lost, we could be hastening the day when we are faced with the choice between living with that threat, or going to war to prevent it.

http://csglobe.com/stephen-hawking-predicted-world-will-end/
When he wasn’t solving the mysteries of black holes and revolutionizing theoretical physics, Stephen Hawking spoke (a lot) about how the world would end.
From Terminator-style robots taking over to Donald Trump, these are some of the late scientist’s most terrifying doomsday predictions.
Humanity is at a “tipping point,” Hawking warned last July.
He added that global warming would cause the Earth to become like Venus, with a global temperature of 482 degrees Fahrenheit and sulphuric acid raining from the sky.
“By the year 2600, the world’s population would be standing shoulder to shoulder and the electricity consumption would make the Earth glow red-hot,” he told a gathering of scientists in Beijing, China.
Our best bet is to leave Earth completely, predicted Hawking.
, but Hawking didn’t trust it one bit.
.
, as part of his 75th birthday celebrations.
, Hawking predicted that humans will have to leave Earth and repopulate elsewhere.
In a documentary titled “Stephen Hawking: Expedition New Earth,” he warned that if humans don’t become a multi-planetary species and settle on other worlds, we could die out in the next century.
.
When the president announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement to reduce CO2 levels, Hawking became one of his most outspoken opponents.

http://csglobe.com/first-marijuana-magic-mushrooms-next/
Advocates in Oregon and Denver are pushing ballot measures to allow possession of mushrooms as new research shows it may be useful in treating depression and anxiety.
Groups in both states are sponsoring ballot measures that would eliminate criminal penalties for possession of the mushrooms whose active ingredient, psilocybin, can cause hallucinations, euphoria and changes in perception.
They point to research showing that psilocybin might be helpful for people suffering from depression or anxiety.
“We don’t want individuals to lose their freedom over something that’s natural and has health benefits,” said Kevin Matthews, the campaign director of , the group working to decriminalize magic mushrooms in Colorado’s capital.
may not portend well for the psilocybin advocates in Oregon and Denver — though their initiatives are more limited than California’s.
only with the approval of a physician and under the supervision of a registered therapist.
None of the proposed initiatives envisions fully legalizing psilocybin mushrooms, which would allow the government to regulate and tax sales in a similar fashion to medical and recreational marijuana.
In Oregon, advocates face a steep climb to qualify their measure for the ballot, because such statewide initiatives typically require hiring paid signature gatherers, said William Lunch, a political analyst for Oregon Public Broadcasting and a former political science professor at Oregon State University.

The Oregon and Denver activists, echoing Lunch, say they hope voters who already accepted pot would now feel comfortable decriminalizing personal use of magic mushrooms as well.
and less addictive than other illegal street drugs.
, says he is wary of the drive for decriminalization. Psilocybin isn’t safe for some people — particularly those with paranoia or psychosis, he said.
Even psilocybin advocates share Hutson’s concerns. “It is such a powerful compound. People should take it very seriously when experimenting,” Matthews said.
These efforts to legitimize hallucinogenic mushrooms come at a time of renewed interest in the potential mental health benefits of psychedelics, including mushrooms, LSD and MDMA (known as ecstasy).
in 2016 by researchers from Johns Hopkins University and New York University found that a single large dose of psilocybin, combined with psychotherapy, helped relieve depression and anxiety in cancer patients.

In California, the campaign to decriminalize psilocybin was always a long shot — even though the famously liberal state legalized possession of recreational marijuana in November 2016 and sales starting this year.
signatures to qualify, and supporters usually have to spend between $1 million and $2 million to pay signature gatherers.
A Monterey County couple leading the decriminalization campaign managed to collect more than 90,000 signatures for their proposal with the help of volunteers, but they halted their efforts late last month.
The initiative would have exempted Californians 21 and over from criminal penalties for possessing, selling, transporting or cultivating psilocybin mushrooms.
under California law, but selling them is a felony. State statistics on psilocybin offenses are scarce, but few people are jailed for such crimes, according to an analysis by the California attorney general’s office.
Merchant said she and Saunders, both medical marijuana advocates, spent about $20,000 of their own money on the campaign.
In Denver, Matthews and his pro-psilocybin colleagues want voters to pass a city ordinance eliminating criminal penalties for possessing, using or growing magic mushrooms.
City officials have cleared the measure for signature gathering. Supporters need 5,000 signatures to get it on the ballot in November. Matthews said he has already lined up dozens of volunteer signature gatherers.
He said he has used mushrooms to help alleviate depression and other mental health problems. A big part of the decriminalization campaign, he said, is promoting responsible use.
Denver, a progressive city in a state that was the first to legalize recreational marijuana, “is a good testing place for this initiative nationwide,” Matthews said. Just getting it on the ballot, whether or not it passes, would be “a huge victory,” he added.
Tom Eckert, a Portland, Ore.-based therapist who leads the psilocybin decriminalization campaign with his wife, Sheri, said the proposed limitations on psilocybin use are important.

http://csglobe.com/america-childish-gambino-video-explained/
Donald Glover had quite the weekend.
The actor, who has been riding high these days with both his series “Atlanta” and his role as young Lando Calrissian in the forthcoming “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” both hosted “Saturday Night Live” and was the musical guest as his rap/R&B alter ego, Childish Gambino.
But it was the video he released for the latter after his “SNL” performance that created a major buzz.
Directed by “Atlanta” director Hiro Murai, the video is pretty surreal and packed full of messages. It’s expansive and filmed in a warehouse, which allows for a lot of action.
As much as your eye will be drawn to Glover as a shirtless Gambino, pay close attention also to what is happening in the background.
Murders occur, but the guns are treated more delicately than human lives in the video — a strong statement given the current debate over gun control.
The imagery also has sparked conversation about several other themes, including police brutality, social media habits and what people are really paying attention to in the United States.
“The fact that Childish Gambino’s ‘This is America’ tackles police brutality, gun violence, media misdirection, and the use of African Americans as a brand shield, all while dancing in Jim Crow-style caricature, shows a transcendence or mere performance and demands attention,” one person tweeted.
The fact that Childish Gambino’s “This is America” tackles police brutality, gun violence, media misdirection, and the use of African-Americans as a brand shield, all while dancing in Jim Crow-style caricature, shows a transcendence or mere performance and demands attention.
Fans have been dissecting the various dance moves in the video, with many determining they represent an overall distraction from the chaos that is happening in the background.
Childish Gambino’s dance moves distracted all of us from the craziness that was happening in the background of the video & that's exactly the point he's trying to make…….
For the people who didn’t understand childish gambino’s video & is only focusing on his dancing is just mind blowing. It clearly shows the violence that is currently going on in America, the people entertaining viral dance moves instead of what’s really happening & so much more.
Yes, that was singer SZA sitting on a car toward the end of the video.
On Sunday, the singer Instagrammed some photos of herself on set.
Liberty .
Her guest appearance could be a clue for the pair working together.

http://csglobe.com/internal-emails-show-fda-withholding-fact-foods-your-pantry-laced-toxic-weedkiller/
Glyphosate is Monsanto’s flagship herbicide, appearing in hundreds of agricultural and gardening products, and although it has been linked to cancer and other serious health issues including birth defects and degenerative diseases, the FDA appears to be withholding the fact that this poison is contaminating many of the foods in your pantry.
Glyphosate has been found in a wide array of popular foods including cereals, staples like corn and soy,  Ben and Jerry’s ice creams, and even in human breastmilk, suggesting that the chemical is making it to your table whether you know it or not.
Sadly, however, the FDA, the agency tasked with protecting the American public from unsafe food, has known for sometime that traces glyphosate are found in many more foods, but after two years of looking into this, the FDA still has not issued a warning to the public.
.
In one email, FDA chemist Richard Thompson admits that food from his own home has tested positive.
to colleagues in an email last year regarding glyphosate. Thompson, who is based in an FDA regional laboratory in Arkansas, wrote that broccoli was the only food he had “on hand” that he found to be glyphosate-free.
that detail agency efforts to ascertain how much of the popular weedkiller is showing up in American food. The tests mark the agency’s first-ever such examination.
Furthermore, the documents show that the FDA is also aware of levels of contamination in popular foods which exceed levels considered safe for consumption.
detected at 6.5 parts per million, an FDA email states. The legal limit is 5.0 ppm. An illegal level would normally be reported to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but an FDA supervisor wrote to an EPA official that the corn was not considered an “official sample”.
In other words, the FDA is doing the testing, but in an unofficial capacity, which therefore does not warrant a public warning. You and your family are consuming an unregulated amount of glyphosate.
Other findings in the documents obtained by The Guardian show that the FDA has also found glyphosate in numerous samples of honey and even oatmeal.
The decision to not inform the public is based on the complex relationship between Monsanto and the government, and the government has long demonstrated its will to stand by Monsanto who suggests that studies showing the toxicity of glyphosate are inconclusive. Never-the-less, the dangers are real, as further noted by The Guardian.
Pesticide exposure through diet is considered a potential health risk. Regulators, Monsanto and agrochemical industry interests say pesticide residues in food are not harmful if they are under legal limits. But many scientists dispute that, saying prolonged dietary exposure to combinations of pesticides can be harmful.
Toxicologist Linda Birnbaum, who is director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), said that current regulatory analysis of pesticide dangers does not account for low levels of dietary exposures.

http://csglobe.com/life-today-vs-how-it-used-to-be/
Sure some thing are easier. It is easier to cook a meal, easier to send a letter, easier to be entertained. But there are many new challenges in society which are just as challenging to face.
In the technological age there are more demands on people to have thing done immediately. There is a lot more choice available to people and this is not always a good thing. It is much harder today to choose a healthy diet which leads to daily struggles which are associated with being overweight or obese.
Most children now have two working parents, less siblings and close relatives and when their parents are home they must fight with the television and Internet to get their attention.
People have more money and become totally consumer driven, with the need to have the latest things becoming so important and the need to spend time with people becoming less important.
People today no longer know how to entertain themselves but must rely on the many entertainment devices. Which leads to problem’s of loneliness, boredom and even suicide.
Over the course of a few short decades, our culture and lifestyle has rapidly changed.

Once complete, these drones will represent the ultimate militarisation of AI and trigger vast legal and ethical implications for wider society.
that it is developing the first drones that can spot and target vehicles and people using artificial intelligence (AI). This is a big step forward.
Whereas current military drones are still controlled by people, this new technology will decide who to kill with almost no human involvement.
and trigger vast legal and ethical implications for wider society.
There is a chance that warfare will move from fighting to extermination, losing any semblance of humanity in the process.
At the same time, it could widen the sphere of warfare so that the companies, engineers and scientists building AI become valid military targets.
are carefully controlled and piloted via satellite. If a pilot drops a bomb or fires a missile, a human sensor operator actively guides it onto the chosen target using a laser.
shows the psychological impact of remote killing.
, in support of autonomous killing drones. Perhaps if these drones drop the bombs, psychological problems among crew members can be avoided.
The weakness in this argument is that you don’t have to be responsible for killing to be traumatised by it. Intelligence specialists and other military personnel regularly analyse graphic footage from drone strikes.
that it is possible to suffer psychological harm by frequently viewing images of extreme violence.
When I interviewed over 100 Reaper crew members for an upcoming book, every person I spoke to who conducted lethal drone strikes believed that, ultimately, it should be a human who pulls the final trigger. Take out the human and you also take out the humanity of the decision to kill.
The prospect of totally autonomous drones would radically alter the complex processes and decisions behind military killings. But legal and ethical responsibility does not somehow just disappear if you remove human oversight. Instead, responsibility will increasingly fall on other people, including artificial intelligence scientists.
, “dual-use” facilities – those which develop products for both civilian and military application – can be attacked in the right circumstances.
because it could fuel Yugoslav tanks as well as fuel civilian cars.
With an autonomous drone weapon system, certain lines of computer code would almost certainly be classed as dual-use. Companies like Google, its employees or its systems, could become liable to attack from an enemy state.
, as might every other civilian contributor to such lethal autonomous systems.
Ethically, there are even darker issues still. The whole point of the self-learning algorithms – programs that independently learn from whatever data they can collect – that technology uses is that they become better at whatever task they are given.
If a lethal autonomous drone is to get better at its job through self-learning, someone will need to decide on an acceptable stage of development – how much it still has to learn – at which it can be deployed.
In militarized machine learning, that means political, military and industry leaders will have to specify how many civilian deaths will count as acceptable as the technology is refined.
Recent experiences of autonomous AI in society should serve as a warning.
fatal experiments with self-driving cars suggest it is pretty much guaranteed that there will be unintended autonomous drone deaths as computer bugs are ironed out.
If machines are left to decide who dies, especially on a grand scale, then what we are witnessing is extermination.
Any government or military that unleashed such forces would violate whatever values it claimed to be defending. In comparison, a drone pilot wrestling with a “kill or no kill” decision becomes the last vestige of humanity in the often inhuman business of war.
and Tesla have both undertaken fatal experiments with self-driving cars, rather than Uber experimenting with a Tesla car as originally stated.

http://csglobe.com/star-wars-speeder-bikes-come-a-step-closer-to-reality-personal-skytrike-takes-to-the-skies-in-first-ever-manned-test-flight/
Star Wars fans have managed to create a ‘personal skytrike’ that looks uncannily like the Imperial speeder bike in the films.
Dubbed ‘Flike’, the tricopter prototype recently took to the air for the first time in a series of manned test flights. In the first test, Flike had a take-off weight of 210kg (463lb) and only made it off the ground for a few seconds.
A second test flight saw the vehicle fly meters off the ground for 30 seconds, while also hovering and compensating for wind, according to a report in Gizmag.
Non-profit, a state-owned applied research institute in Hungary.
‘Flike is a revolutionary, all-electric personal flight device under development in Hungary,’ it creators explain.
Due to its layout, Flike is can be flown by adjusting the rotation speed of individual rotors.
The firm says its airborne behaviour is similar to a helicopter. For instance, it can hover, roll, bank, drift, spin, yaw, climb, turn and dive.
An onboard computer automatically manages the craft’s stability, position and altitude.
The team also says that it has other flight capabilities that are ‘yet to be named’.
The electric motors are powered by lithium polymer batteries, which allows for around 15 to 20 minutes of hover flight or 30 to 40 minutes of cruise flight.
Now that the first flight has been successfully complete, Bay Zoltan wants to build a second prototype that will eventually lead to a commercial product.
The Flike has a coaxial, Y6-layout tricopter, which means that the lift is generated by six rotors, grouped in counter-rotating pairs of three axes, equally located around a circle.

http://csglobe.com/soros-reign-romanian-example/
geopolitical project.
Despite its Orthodox Christian people, its elites always follow a strict pro-EU and pro-American course.
.
The story of Romania deserves attention, because it is exemplary and shows how the methods of establishing Western liberal domination actually work.
In the early ’80s, George Soros began to finance the resistance groups and people in communist regimes in Eastern Europe promoting the ideas of “Open Society” .
In 1979 “Open Society” penetrated Central and Eastern Europe (communist states), but also in many other countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
In 1992, Soros founded – in Budapest – “Central European University”, forming frames selected from across Eastern Europe and the former USSR, including Romania.
Officially, George Soros became engaged in Romanian affairs in the last days of 1989, after the fall of the Ceausescu regime. But some say that the work of the Hungarian-born US magnate of Jewish origin, began long before the fall of the Communist regime.
Even though he has never recognized his involvement in Romania before 1989, Soros admitted that he was involved in other communist countries, financially supporting opponents of these regimes.
Given that Soros founded the Group for Social Dialogue event on the 31st of December 1989, and the Foundation Open Society in the early days of 1990, it is unlikely that the early members were found randomly off the street. It had been prepared since the time of Ceausescu regime.
were a time of ideological subjugation of Romania by the US. Thus the US created the first Romanian private TV Channel SOTI and allocated huge sums of money to the schooling of journalists.
The Soros Foundation was the main contributor to this. All structures of political opposition including independent trade unions, student unions and political parties were funded by the US funds: Soros (Open Society), Freedom House, NED, National Republican Institute.
Thus the US funds and George Soros formed the major part of Romanian political class and journalist community. For example, the current Defense Minister Mihnea Motoc was granted at this time a scholarship at the George Washington University and since that time became a US agent of influence.
As it was in other post-communist countries, Soros aimed to control the education system. Between 1990 and 1994, the Foundation was busy for the elaboration of “textbooks” – written by members of the Foundation – in collaboration with the Ministry of Education.
Soros’ first organization in Romania was Group for Social Dialogue (GDS) with founding members Silviu Brucan, Andrei Plesu, Gabriel Andreescu and Stelian Tanase.
Officially, Soros founded in Bucharest in 1990, the foundation named after him: “Soros Foundation”. Later, the name was changed: “Open Society Foundation” (FSD). It was among the first NGOs established in Romania.
The first direct representative of George Soros in Romania was Sandra Pralong (Sandra Marilyn Andreea Budis) a person who, not coincidentally, emigrated from Romania in the 70’s and then returned after Ceausescu was overthrown .
Sandra Pralong was an adviser to President Emil Constantinescu and today is an adviser to the current Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.
It is worth mentioning that the current Romanian prime-minister Dacian Ciolos, a former EU commissioner for agriculture, was a member of the “Friends of Europe”, an association funded by the Open Society foundation.
A fact he forgot to disclose to the Romanian people. However, his government was often referred to as “the Government of Soros” due to the fact that it is entirely formed from former NGO activists, Soros students, managers of multinational corporations and ardent Atlanticists. So, this country today is openly ruled by the American billionaire.
In addition to GDS and the Soros Foundation, the American financier has developed a myriad of NGO’s related to his structures. Here are just a few names of them: “Soros Advising and Placement Center”, “Soros Educational Advising Center”, the “Union for the Reconstruction of Romania”, “Centre for Partnership and Equality”, “Center for Economic Development”, Foundation “Concept “,” Human Rights Center – Bucharest “,” Association for Human Rights in Romania – Helsinki Committee (APADOR-CH) “. Association “Pro-Democracy”, “Romanian Academic Society” etc., which in turn have given birth to other NGO’s.
Among the members of these organizations you can easily find former ministers, advisers to Romanian presidents, directors of state institutions, influential journalists. Noteworthy is that three of the four Romanian presidents have had advisers or people form Soros network.
APD.
Founded in August 1990 by Adrian Mourousis in Brasov. It was funded, first, by the “National Democratic Institute”, then entered the pyramid of SON. It has 30 branches across the country and over 1,000 members. Specialization: supervision of elections, a parallel vote count, etc. Organizes every year “Summer University in Balvanyos” (Covasna), along with “Liga Pro-Europa” and “Hungarian Youth Union” and the FIDESZ.
is financed besides SON (ie FSD) by the “National Democratic Institute”, “Freedom House”, “USAID” (United States Agency for International Development) and “Westminster Foudation for Democracy”.
(SAR). It is led by Alina Mungiu. Promoted the merger between Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party – which also realized. Thus National Liberal Party, Romanian historical party, which previously had serious souvereignist wing, was completely hijacked by Soros activists. Alina Mungiu is the anti-Orthodox activist and sister of Cristian Mungiu, Romanian film director, decorated by Oscar for his film justifying abortions.
Funding of Mungiu fund comes from the “Open Society Institute” and the “World Bank”, “Freedom House” (James Woolsey), and “Marshall Fund”.
“ASSOCIATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN ROMANIA Helsinki Committee” (APADOR-CH).
Led at first by Renate Weber, then in 1996 Monica Macovei.
Group for Social Dialogue “(GDS).
Founded in 1990. GDS includes the people, described by the media as leading intellectuals of Romania today: Gabriela Adameşteanu Mariana Celac, Andrei Cornea Andrei Oisteanu Adrian Cioroianu etc.
Leading personalities in the network “Soros Open Network Romania” were Renate Weber, Alina Mungiu, Monica Macovei, Cristian Parvulesc, Mihai Razvan Ungureanu , Adrian Cioroianu etc.
One of the best examples of work of Soros network is the career of Mihai Razvan Ungureanu the current head of Romania Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) and former Prime-minister of the state (2012) and Foreign Minister ( 2004-2007). From 1997 Razvan Ungureanu worked for FSD.
This allowed him to benefit from scholarships and internships. Thus, in ’90 -’91, Ungureanu received a scholarship to master in the St. Cross College by University of Oxford. This has allowed him to become later member of the prestigious “European Association for Jewish Studies at Oxford”.
In 1998, Ungureanu became a “Senior Fellow” at “Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies” within its “St. Cross College “(Oxford), the most famous center of this kind in the world. Receiving  the “Posen Award”, Ungureanu also benefited from a scholarship for two years (1996/1997 and 1997/1998), the renowned ” Hebrew University ” ​​in Jerusalem.
In 2000, Ungureanu claimed courses as “Senior Reader” to “NATO School” in Oberammergau (Germany) and in 2003 Ungureanu is “senior Reader” to “George C. Marshall Center for Security Studies” in Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Germany ). Mihai Razvan Ungureanu is just one example of the opportunities offered by FSD and George Soros to young Romanians. The same can be said of many others of those quoted above.
Sandra Pralong – former advisor to President Emil Constantinescu, the current adviser of President Klaus Johannis.
Renate Weber – adviser to President Traian Basescu (2004 – 2005) Liberal MEP.
Adrian Cioflâncă – researcher and former member of the CNSAS, Coat of Tismăneanu Report and Report Elie Wiesel.
Mircea Toma – activist, ActiveWatch.
Michael Bumbes – historian .
Claudiu Crăciun – political scientist, lecturer of the Department of Political Science and European Studies from SNSPA, was expert in the Secretariat General of the Government and the Ministry of Education (2004-2009). His work “The Government Learning Research Project: Assessing Policy Making Reform in Romania” was published under the auspices of the Open Society Network and the Center for Political Studies at the Central European University, both founded by George Soros.

http://csglobe.com/crystal-clear-video-multiple-ufos/
posted some remarkable pictures on the internet that ended up going fairly viral across social media.
They were snaps of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs, which does not mean they are extraterrestrial in origin).
That being said, don’t be fooled, there is a tremendous amount of evidence pointing toward the fact that some of these UFOs, whose presence were officially acknowledged within the mainstream using declassified documents and hundreds of high ranking military/political whistleblowers, are indeed extraterrestrial in origin.
There is ample evidence suggesting that many are ‘ours’ as well.
“As I was driving back to Phoenix this evening, I was a few miles past Parker, AZ when I saw a shooting star with a green hue in the corner of my eye. I kept driving for a few miles and noticed a small orange light far in the distance to my right. At first I thought that maybe a meteor had hit nearby and set a fire in the desert or possibly a distant antenna light.
I didn’t quite think much of it and continued to drive for another three miles. I noticed that the light was gone. I drove another half of a mile and I saw the light appear again. This is when I realized that whatever this was, wasn’t normal.
I was about a quarter of a mile from the crossing between Highway 72 and Highway 95 between Parker and Quartzsite, Arizona.
I immediately pulled over and attached my camera to my tripod. To my SW direction, there were six orange-red lights floating around in the horizon. Some of them would dim out and then brighten back up, others just seemed to float and hover away slowly. They seemed to travel in a parallel pattern with a very bright fiery glisten. I took photos and videos and in less than 15 minutes, the mysterious objects vanished without a trace.
All of the photographs are timestamped and are not edited whatsoever. The video is slightly cropped for better viewing.
Whatever this was, I have never seen anything like this in my life before. Super cool experience.
I have noticed that my cameras clock is set 8 minutes ahead. Which means that the time stamps are all 8 minutes ahead. I also saw a video of the same exact thing but from the opposite end in El Centro, CA. That means that whatever this was, it was visible for at least 100 miles.
.
Below is some footage from Dr. Steven Greer, founder of The Disclosure Project and the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI).
Known to some as the “Father of the Disclosure Movement,” he was instrumental in bringing forth hundreds of military whistleblowers of all ranks, with verified backgrounds, to share their experiences and testify on the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon.
) by Apollo 14 astronaut and the 6th man to walk on the Moon, Dr. Edgar Mitchell.
When it comes to real footage of UFOs (unidentified flying objects), film from the 1991 NASA STS-48 Discovery Space Shuttle mission definitely ranks as some of the best. This footage is real and well-documented, and has been the subject of rigorous scientific investigation by multiple researchers and institutions.
Very interesting to say the least. Many have called out the official explanation that these are ice particles as bogus, and at the 23 second mark to approximately 35 and beyond, you’ll see why.
The top google searchers every single year always show UFOs and extraterrestrials as a hot topic.
.
Perhaps it’s the secrecy around this subject that is really grinding people’s gears and sparking their curiosity. It’s human nature to explore the unknown, and when information is kept from us, there will inevitably be backlash.
“This thing has gotten so highly-classified… it is just impossible to get anything on it. I have no idea who controls the flow of need-to-know because, frankly, I was told in such an emphatic way that it was none of my business that I’ve never tried to make it to be my business since.
We are definitely living in one of the most interesting times in human history. The birth of the industrial, scientific and technological/information revolutions brought with them a host of problems.
warned us about in the past, is the fact that a powerful group of people and the corporations they run, headed by the big banks, have taken control over almost every aspect of our lives.
that are added to it.
, and seeing through the fact that many soldiers are sent to die for corporate interests and an agenda set out by the financial elite.
However, more people are starting to understand our reality and thus making more conscious choices, voting with their dollars.
More and more souls on the plant today desire peace, and that is made clear by all of the humanitarian and activist movements that’ve been unearthed. Not many souls on the planet want to see others suffer, and we have the potential to create a human experience where everybody has their needs met.
This is possible, but there are systems put in place to make you think this is not possible because our economy would be completely destroyed. True, it would be, but that would be a necessary step in the re-design of the human experience.
This type of thinking is changing, the anti-war movement is stronger than ever, and it’s clear that if our planet and our countries were really a democracy, things would be a lot different. We are one human race and there are no need for borders.

http://csglobe.com/schooling-industrial-era-unschooling-future/
Our current compulsory schooling model was created at the dawn of the Industrial Age.
As factories replaced farm work and production moved swiftly outside of homes and into the larger marketplace, 19th century American schooling mirrored the factories that most students would ultimately join.
The bells and buzzers signaling when students could come and go, the tedium of the work, the straight lines and emphasis on conformity and compliance, the rows of young people sitting passively at desks while obeying their teachers, the teachers obeying the principal, and so on—all of this was designed for factory-style efficiency and order.
, but our mass education system remains fully entrenched in factory-style schooling.
By many accounts, mass schooling has become even more restrictive than it was a century ago, consuming more of childhood and adolescence than at any time in our history.
The first compulsory schooling statute, passed in Massachusetts in 1852, required eight to 14-year-olds to attend school a mere 12 weeks a year, six of which were to be consecutive.
This seems almost laughable compared to the childhood behemoth that mass schooling has now become.
Enclosing children in increasingly restrictive schooling environments for most of their formative years, and drilling them with a standardized, test-driven curriculum is woefully inadequate for the Imagination Age.
, Cathy Davidson says that 65 percent of children now entering elementary school will work at jobs in the future that have not yet been invented.
While the past belonged to assembly line workers, the future belongs to creative thinkers, experimental doers, and inventive makers. The past relied on passivity; the future will be built on passion.
Cultivating passion is nearly impossible within a coercive schooling structure that values conformity over creativity, compliance over-exuberance.
, movement is taking off, with more parents migrating from a schooling model of education for their children to a learning one.
With Self-Directed Education, passion is at the center of all learning. Young people follow their interests and pursue their passions, while adults act as facilitators, connecting children and teens to the vast resources of both real and digital communities.
In this model, learning is natural, non-coercive, and designed to be directed by the individual herself, rather than by someone else.
Self-Directed Education and unschooling often take place in homes and throughout communities, but increasingly individuals and organizations are launching self-directed learning centers geared toward homeschoolers with both full- and part-time options.
These centers make Self-Directed Education more accessible to more families in more places, and each has a unique philosophy or focus. Some are geared toward teens and value real-world apprenticeships and immersion; others are makerspaces that emphasize tinkering and technology, and so on.
Instead of complaining about the education status quo, entrepreneurial individuals are building alternatives to school that challenge it.
Centered around passion and an overarching belief in individual self-determination, these entrepreneurs — who are often parents, former school teachers, and others who have become disillusioned by coercive schooling — are freeing young people from an outdated and harmful mass schooling system.
Enlightened parents and innovative entrepreneurs may be the key players in constructing a new education model focused on freedom and designed for the Imagination Age.

http://csglobe.com/neuroscientist-explains-reality-hallucination/
Anil Seth, professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex, explains the link between perception and reality.
Seth believes reality as we know it comes from activity of our brain. Following is a transcript of the video.
Anil Seth: How do we know that we experience the real world? In fact, we probably don’t. Everything that we perceive, everything that we experience, is a result of the brain interpreting the sensory information that comes in in a particular way.
I’m Anil Seth. I’m a professor of neuroscience at the University of Sussex in the UK. Now you could say that all of our experiences are all hallucinated. It’s just that whenever we agree about what’s out there, that’s what we call reality. Brain brings to bear its prior expectations about what’s out there in order to interpret this massive, noisy, and ambiguous sensory information that it continually encounters.
Perception, instead of just being a reflection of what’s actually there in the world, is always this active process of interpretation.
It’s easy to assume that we see with our eyes. In fact, we see with our brains. Our eyes are of course necessary, but what we actually end up perceiving is much more a product of how our brain interprets all this information from the eyes than the eyes being this window into an objective external reality.
And when the balance is disturbed between how the brain interprets sensory information and what the sensory information actually is, well, that’s when people start to see things that other people don’t, and that’s what we call hallucination.
When you look at a cloud, and sometimes you can see faces in clouds, now that’s a kind of hallucination. Other people who will see things that really other people don’t see, that’s just a different balance that they have between how their prior expectations influence the sensory data that comes in.
. That also leads people to have unusual experiences, to see things that aren’t there. Again, it doesn’t mean that these things really exist. It just means that your brain is working in a different way so that its prior expectations come to dominate this sensory information.
We can see a number of things that happen in the brain on psychedelics. One of the things that happens is the brain generally becomes a bit more disorganized. Normally in the brain, different parts of the brain have activity that correlates.
So we see all these networks in the brain with different areas active at the same time, and then they diminish their activity at the same time as well.
How visual hallucinations in the psychedelic state might come about could be that in the psychedelic state, what you perceive is dependent more on the brain than the sensory data that’s coming in through the eyes and the ears. And we have the opportunity now to try to characterize exactly how and why this happens.
But what we experience as being real is a construction of the brain. So when I experience a particular color, that doesn’t mean that color exists out there in the universe, that a red mug is actually painted some color that exists independently of my mind and brain.

http://csglobe.com/hawking-submitted-final-scientific-paper-2-weeks-before-died/
Stephen Hawking submitted his final scientific paper just two weeks before he died, and it lays the theoretical groundwork for discovering a parallel universe.
on Wednesday aged 76, was co-author to a mathematical paper which seeks proof of the “multiverse” theory, which posits the existence of many universes other than our own.
The paper, called “A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation”, had its latest revisions approved on March 4, ten days before Hawking’s death.
, the paper is due to be published by an unnamed “leading journal” after a review is complete.
including the March 2018 update.
According to The Sunday Times, the contents of the paper sets out the mathematics necessary for a deep-space probe to collect evidence which might prove that other universes exist.
The highly theoretical work posits that evidence of the multiverse should be measurable in background radiation dating to the beginning of time. This in turn could be measured by a deep-space probe with the right sensors on-board.
Hertog, who works at KU Leuven University in Belgium, told the Sunday Times he met with Hawking in person to get final approval before submitting the paper.
The newspaper said that if such proof is ever found it would make the scientists behind it likely candidates for a Nobel Prize.
, Hawking would be ineligible to receive it.

http://csglobe.com/mainstream-media-finally-exposes-cia-drug-trafficking-conspiracy-explosive-history-channel-series/
Hopefully, the History Channel’s new documentary will push others to question drug laws.
brought the War on Drugs into full force in 1973. He then signed Reorganization Plan No. 2, which established the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Over the course of five decades, this senseless war has waged on.
that is worse now than ever before.
This is no coincidence.
For years, those of us who’ve been paying attention have seen who profits from this inhumane war — the police state and cartels.
This horrendously corrupt and violent drug war has gotten so bad, that it is getting pushed into the mainstream.
the CIA, obsessed with keeping America safe in the fight against communism, allied itself with the mafia and foreign drug traffickers. In exchange for support against foreign enemies, the groups were allowed to grow their drug trade in the United States.
Promising to be one of the most explosive television series in recent history, the show intends to expose the CIA’s connection to the crack epidemic.
Night one of “America’s War on Drugs” divulges covert Cold War operations that empowered a generation of drug traffickers and reveals the peculiar details of secret CIA LSD experiments which helped fuel the counter-culture movement, leading to President Nixon’s crackdown and declaration of a war on drugs.
, the history of the cartels and their murderous tactics, the era of “Just Say No,” the negative effect of NAFTA, and the unlikely career of an almost famous Midwest meth queen.
If the CIA trafficking cocaine into the United States sounds like some tin foil conspiracy theory, think again. Their role in the drug trade was exposed in 1996 in a critical investigative series “Dark Alliance” by Gary Webb for the San Jose Mercury News.
, Nicaraguan contras and the crack cocaine trade ravaging African-American communities.
to back Webb’s original investigation up.
but that the U.S. government knew about it.
Going even further down the rabbit hole, the History Channel will address how US involvement in Afghanistan turned the country into a virtual heroin factory and how the drug war empowers cartels.
transforming Afghanistan into a narco-state teeming with corruption.
bringing unprecedented levels of violence and sending even more drugs across America’s borders.
The reason why the drug war actually creates a drug and violence problem is simple. And those who profit most from the drug war — drug war enforcers and cartels — all know it.
When the government makes certain substances illegal, it does not remove the demand.
Instead, the state creates crime by pushing the sale and control of these substances into the illegal black markets. All the while, demand remains constant.
We can look at the prohibition of alcohol and the subsequent mafia crime wave that ensued as a result as an example.
The year 1930, at the peak of prohibition, happened to be the deadliest year for police in American history.
, and innumerable poor people slaughtered as the state cracked down on drinkers.
Outlawing substances does not work.
Criminal gangs form to protect sales territory and supply lines. They then monopolize the control of the constant demand. Their entire operation is dependent upon police arresting people for drugs because this grants them a monopoly on their sale.
However, the illegality of drug possession and use is what keeps the low-level users and dealers in and out of the court systems, and most of these people are poor black men. As Dr. Ron Paul has pointed out, black people are more likely to receive a harsher punishment for the same drug crime as a white person.
This revolving door of creating and processing criminals fosters the phenomenon known as Recidivism.
is a fundamental concept of criminal justice that shows the tendency of those who are processed into the system and the likelihood of future criminal behavior.
The War on Drugs takes good people and turns them into criminals every single minute of every single day. The system is setup in such a way that it fans the flames of violent crime by essentially building a factory that turns out violent criminals.
The system knows this too — as the very existence of the police state is dependent upon the drug war. When drugs are legal, there are far fewer doors to kick in, fines to collect, profit prisons to fill, and money to steal.
crippling to the violent foreign drug cartels too.
This is why the Free Thought Project and other open-minded groups all advocate bringing this bloody and criminally ineffective drug war to a sudden and grinding halt.
Hopefully, the History Channel’s new documentary will push others to question drug laws. Hopefully, the documentary wakes people up the idea that legality does not equal morality and that government force, via kidnapping, caging, and killing, is no way to solve an addiction problem. Hopefully.

http://csglobe.com/10-reasons-why-we-dont-need-gm-foods/
Genetically modified (GM) foods are often promoted as a way to feed the world. But this is little short of a confidence trick. Far from needing more GM foods, there are urgent reasons why we need to ban them altogether.
A 2008 World Bank report concluded that increased biofuel production is the major cause of the increase in food prices. Biofuels are crops grown for fuel rather than food.
Despite the promises, GM has not increased the yield potential of any commercialised crops. In fact, studies show that the most widely grown GM crop, GM soya, has suffered reduced yields.
A report that analyzed nearly two decades worth of peer reviewed research on the yield of the primary GM food/feed crops, soybeans and corn (maize), reveals that despite 20 years of research and 13 years of commercialization, genetic engineering has failed to significantly increase US crop yields. The author, former US EPA and US FDA biotech specialist Dr Gurian-Sherman, concludes that when it comes to yield, “Traditional breeding outperforms genetic engineering hands down.
US government data shows that in the US, GM crops have produced an overall increase, not decrease, in pesticide use compared to conventional crops.
A major UN/World Bank-sponsored report compiled by 400 scientists and endorsed by 58 countries concluded that GM crops have little to offer global agriculture and the challenges of poverty, hunger, and climate change, because better alternatives are available. In particular, the report championed “agroecological” farming as the sustainable way forward for developing countries.
Integrated Pest Management and other innovative low-input or organic methods of controlling pests and boosting yields have proven highly effective, particularly in the developing world. Other plant breeding technologies, such as Marker Assisted Selection (non-GM genetic mapping), are widely expected to boost global agricultural productivity more effectively and safely than GM.
Genetic modification is a crude and imprecise way of incorporating foreign genetic material (e.g. from viruses, bacteria) into crops, with unpredictable consequences. The resulting GM foods have undergone little rigorous and no long-term safety testing. However, animal feeding tests have shown that GM foods have toxic effects, including abnormal changes in organs, immune system disturbances, accelerated ageing, and changes in gene expression. Very few studies have been published on the direct effects on humans of eating a GM food. One such study found unexpected effects on gut bacteria, but was never followed up.
It is claimed that Americans have eaten GM foods for years with no ill effects. But these foods are unlabeled in the US and no one has monitored the consequences. With other novel foods like trans fats, it has taken decades to realize that they have caused millions of premature deaths.
As a spokesperson for Asgrow, a subsidiary of Monsanto, said, “If you put a label on genetically engineered food, you might as well put a skull and crossbones on it.” The GM industry has got around the problem of consumer rejection of GM foods by hiding them in animal feed. Meat, eggs and dairy products from animals raised on the millions of tons of GM feed imported into Europe do not have to be labelled. Some studies show that contrary to GM and food industry claims, animals raised on GM feed ARE different from those raised on non-GM feed.[19]  Other studies show that if GM crops are fed to animals, GM material can appear in the resulting products[20] and affect the animals’ health. So eating these “stealth GMOs” may affect the health of consumers.
GM contamination of conventional and organic food is increasing. An unapproved GM rice that was grown for only one year in field trials was found to have extensively contaminated the US rice supply and seed stocks. In Canada, the organic oilseed rape industry has been destroyed by contamination from GM rape. In Spain, a study found that GM maize “has caused a drastic reduction in organic cultivations of this grain and is making their coexistence practically impossible”.
The time has come to choose between a GM-based, or a non-GM-based, world food supply.
“If some people are allowed to choose to grow, sell and consume GM foods, soon nobody will be able to choose food, or a biosphere, free of GM. It’s a one way choice, like the introduction of rabbits or cane toads to Australia; once it’s made, it can’t be reversed.” – Roger Levett, specialist in sustainable development.
The big biotech firms pushing their GM foods have a terrible history of toxic contamination and public deception. GM is attractive to them because it gives them patents that allow monopoly control over the world’s food supply. They have taken to harassing and intimidating farmers for the “crime” of saving patented seed or “stealing” patented genes — even if those genes got into the farmer’s fields through accidental contamination by wind or insects.

http://csglobe.com/why-am-i-so-fat/
This is the question many Americans are asking themselves these days. Why am I so fat? The answer lies in a combination of issues, none of which involve swallowing the latest ultra expensive diet pill.
The other problem we are running into is the food itself. It used to be that if you read a label on a packaged food item you could readily understand it. These days that isn’t the case. There are multi-syllabic words that require a degree in chemical engineering to understand. This should be a warning sign. If you don’t know what it is and cannot even pronounce it, put it down.
One of the most prevalent additives in the food supply these days is HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup). Though this one is easy to say and we have been bombarded with advertisements sponsored by the Corn Council telling us not to worry and how corn syrup is just like sugar only made from corn made to put our minds at ease. The reality of it is corn syrup is added to things that do not need to be sweetened in the first place (such as chicken salads, condiments like ketchup, and even breads) and it does cause weight gain. Additionally, most of the corn produced here in the USA has now been contaminated with genetically modified seed crops. This corn is not made by nature. It is man made in a laboratory. It is not healthy and can cause a wide array of ill health effects including:tumors, metabolic syndrome, liver degeneration and necrosis, abnormal aging and premature death. These effects have been proven in studies done on rats, and I am quite sure will become more and more evident in the human population as time passes and more of these GMO foods are consumed.
.
may also cause damage to the central nervous system. Once it enters the intestines it is converted in to two amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine as well as methyl alcohol and formaldehyde! Methyl alcohol can cross the blood brain barrier causing brain damage, blindness or cancer.
The companies manufacturing these products do not care about your health. They do not care about your weight. They only care about their profit off of you and your willingness to buy their toxic products.
This is your body and your life. Take control of it again.
” your body reacts differently than it does to the chemical and modified and processed counterparts.
This is another primary reason for weight gain…. In eating, our bodies seek nutrition to be able to run properly. Your body signals that it is hungry. You buy a Big Mac, fries and a soda. You eat your lunch (consuming upwards of 1300 calories) only to find that you may actually still be hungry! HOW is that even possible? Many people will feel horrible about themselves because of this… when in reality, it isn’t simply a lack of willpower, your body didn’t get what it needed in that meal. In turn it tells you so and requests more food. Quantity of calories is not what counts, we have all been lead to believe that “a calorie is a calorie” that simply is not true. Nutritional content is what is important. When your body eats a meal, regardless of calories, which contains proper nutrition you feel satisfied. You will no longer have the urge to keep eating.
Now, add to the things we are choosing to put in our bodies the sedentary lifestyle many of us lead and you have a recipe for disaster. The average American works a job where not a lot of physical activity is required. The old phrase “if you don’t use it, you lose it!” applies. As we age in complacency just going through the routine of daily life we are losing muscle tone and gaining fat.
We as a nation have somehow been duped into believing the media when it tells us that magic pills or sprinkling some new random substance all over our food before we eat it is our answer to losing weight. Many advertised on television don’t even tell you what the ingredients are, just expecting you to trust them because they purchased advertising time on your favorite station. This is dangerous. Always know what you are consuming so that you can judge for yourself if it is safe and worth the risk.
Add in more movement to your life. Go for a walk, park away from the stores, take the stairs, choose activities you find fun that require you to get physical – hiking, canoeing, going to the gym or a fitness class you like: yoga, martial arts, aerobics, zumba, any increase in activity is positive.
Try to change your mindset when it comes to eating. Food IS fuel for the body. Its not there to comfort you or keep you occupied. So before you snack, ask yourself… Am I actually hungry? If you are, great. Carry on. If you are not, then put it down. This will recondition your mind when done continually.
Cut out of your food intake: all artificial sweeteners. Read the labels, you will be shocked to see how much food has hidden corn syrup in them.
Eat organic: When you grocery shop for fruits and vegetables look at the stickers. They are coded. If the code starts with a 9 – great! It’s grown organically. 4 – conventionally grown, and 8 – don’t touch it. This is GMO guaranteed produce.
Find an organic café or make your meals at home – chain restaurants and most restaurants in general buy their food as low cost as possible to be able to keep the prices low and profit high. This also means using lesser quality foods.
And last but not least – drink pure clean water – as close to a gallon a day as you can is recommended.
Good health IS your natural state. Believe it. Live it.

.
The cyber-insects, dubbed Marsbees, are the size of bumblebees but have giant wings to generate sufficient lift to hover in the Martian atmosphere, which is around 100 times thinner than Earth’s.
Developed by US and Japanese scientists, the bees would be fitted with sensors and wireless communication devices so they could map terrain, take samples, or even look for signs of life, such as methane emissions.
Although rovers are already exploring Mars, they move incredibly slowly. Since landing in 2012, Nasa’s Curiosity rover has traveled just 11.2 miles.
The Marsbees, would have a mobile base, such as a rover, where they could recharge after they had been deployed.
, said: “Marsbees are robotic flapping wing flyers of a bumblebee size with cicada sized wings.
The project is one of 25 early stage innovations which have been selected by Nasa from 230 proposals as part of the Space Agency’s Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) scheme.
All receive a cash boost of around $125,000 from Nasa to fund research for nine months and can then apply to be selected from Phase II funding.
“The NIAC program gives Nasa the opportunity to explore visionary ideas that could transform future Nasa missions by creating radically better or entirely new concepts while engaging America’s innovators and entrepreneurs as partners in the journey,” said Jim Reuter, acting associate administrator of Nasa’s Space Technology Mission Directorate.
Other schemes selected include a steam powered jumping robot named ‘Sparrow’ capable of exploring icy ocean world’s such as Saturn’s moon Titan, which many experts believe holds the best chance for finding life in the galaxy.
, said that the hopping motion of Sparrow could help even when teams did not know the terrain.
“The employment of a multi-hop architecture allows for the rapid traverse of great distances, enabling a single mission to reach multiple geologic units within a timespan conducive to system survival in a harsh radiation environment.
Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has also received funding for a shape-shifting robot which would change depending on whether it was flying in the atmosphere, rolling on a smooth surface, floating on lakes, or exploring caves.
The bot, dubbed ‘shapeshifter’ is a flying amphibious robot (FAR), comprised of smaller robotic units, referred to as cobots which can break away to carry out independent tasks.
also won funding to develop a ‘biobot’, a rover type robot, which would trundle alongside astronauts on lengthy missions, connected by an umbilical cord. to provide them with oxygen, food and water. The companion robot would also be able to carry communications equipment and high-resolution cameras.
Dr David Akin, said: “Astronauts involved in future lunar or Mars exploration will be on the surface for weeks or months rather than days, and will be involved in regular EVA (extra vehicle activity) operations.

http://csglobe.com/lawmaker-says-recent-snowfall-caused-rothschilds-controlling-climate/
A D.C. lawmaker responded to a brief snowfall Friday by publishing a video in which he espoused a conspiracy theory that Jewish financiers control the weather.
D.C. Council member Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8) posted the video to his official Facebook page at 7:21 a.m. as snow flurries were hitting the nation’s capital.
The video, shot through the windshield of a car driving west on Interstate 695 through downtown Washington, shows snowy skies while White narrates.
“Man, it just started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man. Y’all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation,” he says.
, an 18th-century Jewish banker who lived in what is today Frankfurt, Germany.
The family has repeatedly been subject over the years to anti-Semitic conspiracy theories alleging that they and other Jews clandestinely manipulate world events for their advantage.
Rabbi Daniel Zemel of Temple Micah in Northwest Washington denounced White’s remarks, saying they contribute to a growing mood of intolerance in the United States.
The Anti-Defamation League reported last month that ­anti-Semitic incidents in the District more than doubled in 2017, compared with 2015. That follows a similar escalation nationwide.
However, about four hours after The Washington Post published this story online Sunday, White sent a statement of apology via text message.
White’s video statements appear to echo beliefs, found lurking in corners of the Internet, that the Rockefeller Foundation’s Resilient Cities initiative — which provides grants to cities, including the District, to address environmental and economic problems — is actually part of a secret scheme to control and reduce the population of North America.
Some conspiracy theorists also think the Rothschilds, acting in conjunction with the Rockefeller family, have technology to manipulate the weather — for example, by causing freak storms that wreak havoc on people, farms and livestock.
In a video posted to YouTube this year titled “Kill Cities — Designed by Rothschild and Rockefeller: Resilient Cities Are Human Death Zones,” Internet commentator Deborah Tavares — a Northern California resident who argues, among other things, that climate change and wireless electricity meters are tools in a plot of global domination — calls the Resilient Cities program a “diabolical” effort to manipulate people.
and Freemasons — have increasingly bobbed to the surface of American politics in recent years.
The Republican Party’s 2012 platform embraced what had previously been fringe fears of a 1992 United Nations environmental accord known as Agenda 21, stating that it was “erosive of American sovereignty.” Assertions that the pact was cover for a global plot had become popular among tea party groups battling local, state and federal environmental regulations.
Speculation that high-ranking Democratic Party officials, including former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, were involved in a child sex-trafficking ring run out of a D.C. restaurant led to the infamous “Pizzagate” episode in December 2016.
A North Carolina man showed up with a Colt AR-15 military-style rifle and a .38-caliber Colt revolver at Comet Ping Pong, a pizza joint in Northwest Washington, saying he planned to investigate the allegations.
He fired multiple shots inside the restaurant before police arrested him. No one was harmed.

http://csglobe.com/man-one-ups-tesla-inventing-electric-car-never-needs-charging/
The concept of the electric car has been around for a very long time, and as with any other world revolutionizing technology, it’s taken a while to actually bring them out and have them on the market.
It would be great to just throw out all of the red tape that delays the process, but our world doesn’t work that way, in fact, it’s quite the opposite and in an industry dominated by oil, it’s hard to make your presence felt.
Giant corporations have monopolies on technologies like this, and they themselves are going to want to control the clean energy market, just as they have been with regards to oil.
Clean energy technology has huge implications, not just from an environmental standpoint, but a geopolitical one as well.
Perhaps that’s why it’s taken so long for many of them to see the light of day, and many of them never do.
It’s great to see companies like Tesla out there, but by now, it should be illegal for any manufacturer to make a car that runs on oil rather than electricity or some other form of green technology.
Take for example, the “Invention Secrecy Act,” it was written up in 1951. Under this act, patent applications on new inventions can be subject to secrecy orders.
These orders can restrict their publication if government agencies believe that their disclosure would be harmful to national security.
As reported by the Federation of American Scientists, there were over 5000 inventions that were under secrecy orders at the end of Fiscal Year 2014, which marked the highest number of  secrecy orders in effect since 1994.
Pretty crazy, but definitely gives you something to think critically about, which is what we’re all about here at Collective Evolution and why I put the information above in this article, but let’s get to it.
.
“By revealing undisclosed substance (industry secreted) to radio wavelengths, the Eco-friendly power generator has the capacity to funnel the power generated into function electrical energy.
assertion is always that he has moved past the rules of preservation of energy as generally comprehended as equivalent shift of energy from a single form to a different one proclaiming that this kind of “discovery” displays the application of basic gel battery packs in series of 220 volts generating a greater output in electrical power (500,000 Watts).
This may be old news to some, but Collective Evolution recently came across it. A news broadcast from Zimbabwe aired the story, one of Africa’s news leaders SABC Digital News.
You would think that an electric car that does not require a charge, and can basically run indefinitely (as long as the parts stay intact) would be huge news. But, it’s not, and it seems such technologies never are.
Right now, he is residing in California. Why did they do this? Was it because they came across a revolutionary with the power to change the world, or is it because they want to keep that which threatens their entire geo-political framework close to home so they can keep an eye on it, and control it? Who knows. But it’s always important to question the intentions of our government.
When I read the article in the Zambian Observer , coupled with the fact that the United States government instantaneously showed interest on a story that hasn’t received any publicity, I thought of Stan Meyer, another person who actually invented a water powered car, which also received very little attention when it came to making the news available to the masses.
, it also describes the whole process.

http://csglobe.com/know-trump-really/
ou need know only two things about the Trump presidency to understand what kind of man he is. We learned fairly early on that the Trump administration is the first in memory to bar release of its daily logs of visitors to the White House.
More recently, we learned that Trump demanded from the start that all senior White House staff sign NDA’s, non-disclosure agreements, similar to the contracts signed by the employees of the Trump Organization and his campaign.
. They are the actions of a dictator.
Do you think they thought of themselves as so all-powerful that they could contractually demand the kind of loyalty represented by signing a non-disclosure pact? You have to look overseas, to totalitarian regimes headed by dictatorial strongmen, to find anything comparable.
It took intervention with a lawsuit filed by the good-government group Public Citizen to get the logs of a few offices within the Executive Office of the President, including the Office of Management and Budget, released to the public.
The names of all other visitors to the White House — everyone who sees the President, say, or the chief of staff, or “senior adviser” Jared Kushner — are kept secret.
The Secret Service, which maintains the White House logs, has been instructed to forward all of the logs not covered by the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to the White House Office of Records Management, which is exempted from FOIA requests. That office has said that once the logs of visitors are received from the Secret Service, they are destroyed.
.
– is beside the point. They are evidence that Trump cares only about loyalty to himself, not to the Constitution or the nation.
It is perhaps one of the greater ironies of the Trump presidency that his White House has leaked more to the press than any administration in memory.
The latest leak to come out was the recent revelation that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met in the White House with the head of Apollo Global Management, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, and the CEO of Citigroup, just before both of those financial giants loaned more than a half billion dollars to Kushner’s private real estate company.
The only reason we know that the two Kushner meetings is because someone in the White House talked to the press. If Trump had his way, knowledge of those meetings would have never been released, and if the identity of the person who revealed the meetings became known, he or she would have faced punishment under the flawed NDA’s that were signed.
I am focusing on these two policies because they are overt, tangible evidence of totalitarian actions taken by President Trump. But we have had plenty of other evidence of Trump’s totalitarian instincts.
Since the beginning, it’s been evident that Trump is a bully who enjoys intimidating and pushing around anyone he thinks is in his way.
Remember “Little Marco” and “Lyin’ Ted” during the primaries? Trump’s bullying monikers for his opponents got a lot less amusing when “Crooked Hillary” morphed into chants of “lock her up” at the Republican National Convention and during his rallies.
Back then, we had no way to know that he would turn the “lock her up” rallying cry into a very real threat when he started tweeting demands that his Attorney General use the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute his former opponent for imaginary crimes involving uranium sold to Russia and the Clinton Foundation.
This is not the way the presidents of democracies ordinarily act, but it is the way that dictators act all the time. A glance at prosecutions of opponents by the totalitarian regimes in Turkey and Russia tells you all you need to know. The only two leaders Trump speaks highly of consistently are Putin and Erdogan.
We know that Trump is an inveterate liar because the Washington Post has keep an actual running count of his lies (now topping 2,436) since he took office. There is another word for lying on this scale.
It is propaganda, and Trump doesn’t just rely on his own lies to mislead the public. He has had his spokesman deliver lies from the podium in the White House press room quite literally since the day he took office, when Sean Spicer tried to make the laughable case that Trump’s inauguration was the best attended in history.
Trump and his people have lied repeatedly that they had no contacts with Russians during the campaign, even as it was revealed that such contacts were regular and frequent.
His cabinet secretaries have lied about everything from their travel arrangements to how they expend taxpayer dollars to the qualifications of those they have nominated to positions within their departments.
The only difference between the Trump administration and those of totalitarian leaders in other countries is that Trump doesn’t actually have a formal Department of Propaganda, although his press operations throughout the government effectively function as one.
Trump made it a feature of his White House to put members of his own family into positions of responsibility and power, and he loaded up his cabinet and administration with wealthy cronies who had no qualifications whatsoever for the jobs they were appointed to. Dictators of totalitarian regimes do the same thing.
At least Rex Tillerson, while not exactly a towering figure in the world of foreign policy, had run an organization of equivalent size to the State Department and had negotiated business deals in countries all over the world. But now Trump has pushed Tillerson out, along with a plethora of senior staff at the White House, some of whom he hasn’t bothered replacing.
According to Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, Trump is said to be “more confident” in his job now that he has consolidated his power and gotten rid of some of the “adults in the room” who were supposed to be keeping him in check.
Chief economic adviser Gary Cohn was supposed to be one of the people who would blunt Trump’s worst instincts. At least that’s what we have been told by Republican pooh-bahs who have sought to compartmentalize the President by pointing to “good Trump” (tax cuts for the rich) while ignoring or trying to conceal “bad Trump” (Russiagate, Stormy Daniels, tweeting, ignorance of and hostility to policy).
But there never was a “good Trump.” There is just Trump, and he made it crystal clear who he is when he called Vladimir Putin yesterday, against the advice of his national security team. Presidents of free nations don’t call brutal dictators and congratulate them on their fake “electoral victories,” but fellow dictators do.

http://csglobe.com/france-declares-all-new-rooftops-must-be-topped-with-plants-or-solar-panels/
A new law recently passed in France mandates that all new buildings that are built in commercial zones in France must be partially covered in either plants or solar panels.
, as they are called, have an isolating effect which helps to reduce the amount of energy needed to heat a building during the winter or cool it in the summer.
They are capable of retaining rainwater and reducing problems with runoff, and also offer birds a place to call home in the urban jungle.
French environmental activists originally wanted to pass a law that would make the green roofs cover the entire surface of all new roofs. However, partially covered roofs make for a great start, and are still a huge step in the right direction.
Some say the law that was passed is actually better, as it gives the business owners a chance to install solar panels to help provide the buildings with renewable energy, thereby leaving even less of a footprint.
Green roofs are already very popular in Germany and Australia, as well as Canada’s city of Toronto! This  by-law was adopted in 2009, by the city of Toronto which mandated green roofs on all new industrial and residential buildings.
Adding natural beauty and major aesthetic improvement to buildings, which in turn increases the investment opportunity.
Helping contribute to landfill diversion by prolonging the life of waterproofing membranes, using recycled materials, and prolonging the service of heating, ventilation, and HVAC systems through decreased use.
Green roofs assist with storm water management because water is stored by the substrate, then taken up by plants, and thus returned to the atmosphere through transpiration and evaporation. They also retain rainwater and moderate the temperature of the water and act as natural filters for the water that does run off. They delay the time at which runoff occurs, which results in decreased stress on sewer systems during peak periods.
The plants on green roofs do a great job of capturing airborne pollutants and other atmospheric deposition. They can also filter noxious gasses.
They open up new areas for community gardens, commercial and recreational space in busy cities where this space is generally quite limited.
France is definitely on the right track, but it should be a mandate that all new buildings being built in North America, and even worldwide, adopt this amazing idea to reap all of the potential benefits.
Sadly though, for fans of green infrastructure and renewables alike, this news is more wishful thinking than reality, for now.
, the proposed law had potential to push the nation into the next phase of sustainability. The idea received applause across social media, blogs, and green news websites.
From reducing stormwater runoff, providing energy efficiency, wildlife habitat, and minimizing the urban heat island effect, the reasons to be excited about green roofs were clear.
During the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, France signed the Biological Diversity treaty, an international effort to develop strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.
In 2010 the Nagoya Protocol was adopted; an action plan for preserving biodiversity through 2020. By 2011, France developed its National Biodiversity Strategy, and the green roof policy was one of its results. Its roots therefore reach back to the early 1990s.
In 2015, these long standing efforts appeared to be coming to fruition. The biodiversity initiative that aimed to make France a nation of excellence for green and blue development was under review.
At the time, 564 propositions were examined, and then sent back with 225 amendments. The green roof policy (Article 36), although popularized, was merely one proposal among hundreds, and along with many others, was ultimately struck down.
, is currently lobbying to revive Article 36, but it faces opposition from the commercial industry.
Building owners are refusing to bear the additional construction expenses, threatening to simply pass them along onto consumers if the policy is passed. The proposed green roof policy therefore remains a project at this point.
Originally the policy solely mandated green roofs, but then morphed to include the option of installing solar panels instead. This amendment has sparked discussion amongst those few who understand that solar arrays and green roof systems aren’t mutually exclusive.
Contrary to their usual rivalry in the marketplace, the two technologies don’t necessarily have to compete for photons or rooftop real estate; they can actually be configured to work together synergistically.
Around the globe, cities are working to become more sustainable through green, white, and blue roofs, solar and wind energy, and an array of carbon offsetting incentives. What’s unique about the French law is that it is not isolated to Paris or Lyon, but rather the whole nation.
Regardless of never actually having become a law though, the idea remains a sensation around the globe where it is falsely believed to be an actively implemented policy.
Around the world cities are taking steps toward a more sustainable future. From individuals enjoying fresh produce, to the public experiencing less pollutants in their water, and buildings that save on electric bills, it’s clear that investing in green roofs is a wise decision.
It’s still up in the air if incentives, as opposed to mandates, ultimately lead to more cities embracing green roofs. In France, business owners want the path of least resistance. To invest their own money in a cost not shared with the government has caused a huge pushback on the green roof law.
If the law does pass, France will pioneer a new frontier of nationwide green roof policy. Only time will tell if this will trump the results found in the current format of city-run programs.

http://csglobe.com/conspiracy-theories-monsanto-true/
If we had a dime for every kooky conspiracy theory we’ve heard alleging some vast corporate conspiracy to exploit the treasures of the earth, destroy the environment and poison people with unknown carcinogens all while buying off politicians to cover their tracks, we would be rich.
.
Lets take the case of the $60 billion ag-chemicals powerhouse, Monsanto, and their controversial herbicide, Roundup as an example.
is Monsanto’s blockbuster weedkiller, credited with transforming U.S. agriculture, with a majority of farm production now using genetically modified seeds resistant to the chemical.
For years the company has assured farmers that their weed killing product was absolutely safe to use. As proof, Monsanto touted the approval of the chemical by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
the EPA to work in concert to kill and/or discredit independent, albeit inconvenient, cancer research conducted by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)…More on this later.
But, before we get into the competing studies, here is a brief look at the ‘extensive’ work that Monsanto and the EPA did prior to originally declaring Roundup safe for use (hint: not much).
As the excerpt below reveals, the EPA effectively declared Roundup safe for use without even conducting tests on the actual formulation, but instead relying on industry research on just one of the product’s active ingredients.
“EPA’s minimal standards do not require human health data submissions related to the formulated product – here, Roundup. Instead, EPA regulations require only studies and data that relate to the active ingredient, which in the case of Roundup is glyphosate.
And while the revelations above are quite damning by themselves, this is where things get really interesting.
afford the $250,000 bill that would come with conducting a legitimate scientific study led by accredited scientists.
Finally, when all else fails, you call in those “special favors” in Washington D.C. that you’ve paid handsomely for over the years.
All of which begs the question of whether the D.C. swamp is just too large to be drained.

http://csglobe.com/could-us-win-world-war-iii-without-using-nuclear-weapons/
war has hit a new high. But many of the people seriously engaged in this weighty discussion often get it wrong.
When it comes to estimating military capability, the Western media is principally concerned with the weapons capabilities of weaker states – and it rarely pays much attention to the colossal capability of the US, which still accounts for most of the world’s defense spending.
before they can be used.
with ranges from 200-600 miles. Barely visible to radar, these are designed to destroy “hardened” targets such as nuclear missile silos. Russia and China, by contrast, have nothing of equivalent quantity or quality with which to threaten the US mainland.
in the Mediterranean – and US standing forces in the area include six destroyers equipped with scores of cruise missiles and anti-missile systems. At the other end of Europe, the Russian military is threatening the small Baltic states, but it is rarely noted that the Russian Baltic fleet is the same size as Denmark’s and half the size of Germany’s.
worldwide if its marine assault ships are included.
But overhanging all this, of course, is the nuclear factor.
. But once again, the US’s non-nuclear capabilities are all too often overlooked.
, it is to use conventional weapons to attack anywhere on Earth in under 60 minutes.
This is not to say the task would be small. In order to destroy Russia’s nuclear missiles before they can be launched, the US military would need to first blind Russian radar and command and communications to incoming attack, probably using both physical and cyber attacks. It would then have to destroy some 200 fixed and 200 mobile missiles on land, a dozen Russian missile submarines, and Russian bombers. It would then need to shoot down any missiles that could still be fired.
with an F15 jet fighter.) That said, the West is very dependent on satellites too, and Russia and China continue to develop their own anti-satellite systems.
and that are any way out of their range.
in constantly shadowing Soviet submarines as they left their bases throughout the Cold War. Since then, Russian forces have declined and US anti-submarine warfare has been revived, raising the prospect that Russian submarines could be taken out before they could even launch their missiles.
; all are designed to destroy targets protected by deep concrete and steel bunkers. But a problem for US war planners is that it might take hours too long for their missile-carrying planes to reach these targets – hence the need to act in minutes.
. Intercontinental ballistic missiles take just 30 minutes to fly between the continental US’s Midwest and Siberia; if launched from well-positioned submarines, the Navy’s Tridents can be even quicker, with a launch-to-target time of under ten minutes.
, the development work came close to completion, but apparently ceased in 2013.
Nonetheless, the US has continued to develop other technologies across its armed services to attack targets around the world in under an hour – foremost among them hypersonic missiles, which could return to Earth at up to ten times the speed of sound, with China and Russia trying to keep up.
described how these missile rail cars would be so hard to find that Prompt Global Strike might not be as effective as the US would like – but taken at face value, the article implies that the rest of the Russian nuclear arsenal is in fact relatively vulnerable.
its proficiency at targeting mobile ground-based missiles. Those skills now use remote sensors to attack small ground targets at short notice in the myriad counter-insurgency operations it’s pursued since 2001.

and then war did not negatively impact presidents Clinton or George W. Bush. Neither might the prospect of similar casualties in Iran or North Korea or other states, especially if “humanitarian” precision weapons are used.
found that the US public would not oppose the preemptive use of even nuclear weapons provided that the US itself was not affected. And nuclear Trident offers that temptation.
, which played a vital part in bringing the Cold War to a largely peaceful end.
Like the Kaiser in 1914, perhaps Trump or one of his successors will express dismay when faced with the reality a major US offensive unleashes. But unlike the Kaiser, who saw his empire first defeated and then dismembered, perhaps a 21st-century US president might get away with it.

http://csglobe.com/worrying-personal-information-facebook-has/
after information on millions of users was leaked by a third party.
The hashtag #DeleteFacebook has trended online and many users have chosen to download copies of their Facebook data to better understand what information the social network has collected about them.
These files, which Facebook enables users to download freely, confirm the company has a wide range of information available on people, beyond the obvious content that is visible on someone’s profile.
In going through their own files, several users have reported alarm at Facebook’s data-gathering because their files were found to contain phone call and SMS message history logs.
The data included time and date information of calls and messages sent to friends and family.
However, the social network has already responded to reports on the issue, asserting that this collection is not done without first gaining user permission.
Facebook said the measure is an opt-in feature for the Messenger for Android app and the streamlined version of the site – Facebook Lite – and was designed to help better connect users.
“You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case,” the company said.
As well as the list of friends a user has on their Facebook account, the names and contact information – such as phone numbers and email addresses – of anyone saved to a device on which you use Facebook also appear as part of the data.
Again though this is an optional feature, Facebook asks users first if it can access their contacts list as a way of finding and suggesting connections on the social network.
The process is also common across many social media and other apps, usually occurring shortly after first joining a service.
But it does means some people without a Facebook account could see their phone number become part of the platform’s data archive, should any of their friends or family be on the site.
Facebook’s data on users includes not just their current friends list and the date that online friendship began, but also a list of friend requests a user has declined and those friends they have removed from their profile.
The data also features lists of friend requests sent by the user that were declined by others, offering a detailed picture on interactions with others on the site.

http://csglobe.com/americans-starting-suffer-trumps-health-care-sabotage/
IT is a tribute to the resilience of the United States’ public and private institutions that, despite President Trump’s incoherent management, the country has, by many measures, continued to improve, notching its lowest unemployment rate since 2000 in the latest federal employment update.
But the effects of the president’s underinformed instincts, enabled by the ideologues in his administration, are beginning to show up in some of the numbers, representing real pain that Americans are suffering for Mr. Trump’s deficient leadership.
last week that the rate of working-age Americans without health insurance in the group’s annual survey rose to 15.5 percent, up about three percentage points since 2016.
The rate of uninsured working-age Americans hit 21.9 percent in those areas, up nearly six percentage points over two years.
Nationally, the spike has been particularly bad at the modest end of the income scale, rising nearly five percentage points since 2016 for low-income, working-age Americans.
Obamacare critics regularly describe all problems as the inevitable result of a poorly designed law. But the numbers suggest that the critics’ sabotage efforts are to blame.
After impressive declines during President Barack Obama’s second term, the fund found that the uninsured rate increased in both of the years Mr. Trump has been in office.
During the campaign, Mr. Trump regularly complained that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) left too many Americans uncovered. The result of nearly a year and a half of Mr. Trump’s leadership is 4 million people added to that group.
Obamacare was never perfect. But Commonwealth Fund analysts noted that, rather than fixing the law’s problems, Republicans have done concrete things to worsen them.
“These include the administration’s deep cuts in advertising and outreach during the marketplace open-enrollment periods, a shorter open enrollment period, and other actions that collectively may have left people with a general sense of confusion about the status of the law,” they wrote.
Indeed, the fund found that 5 percent of non-elderly adults plan to drop coverage in response to the mandate repeal. That number may seem small, but if it is younger and healthier people dropping out, it will raise costs for everyone else.
States must do their best to fill gaps. They can establish reinsurance programs that help insurers with high-cost patients, impose individual mandates within their own borders and run open-enrollment advertising campaigns of their own. In some states, at least, the misery of going without health insurance might be easier to avoid.

“Yes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. . . .  We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time. . . .
As recent as a decade ago, avid UFO and extraterrestrial researchers were unable to speak openly about their research without being ridiculed.
Today, the topic has gained considerable credibility and popularity, so much so that not only are high ranking figures from military, political, and academic spheres speaking out, but also popular global figures as well, and particularly at prestigious conferences around the world.
Previously classified documents that have been released from dozens of governments around the world have also allowed this topic to enter the respected public domain.
, on the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon.
at the same conference. The main theme of that conference was contact with intelligent extraterrestrials, and learning from outer space.
.
. Aside from a phenomenal businessman, Tesla is an activist who uses his wealth and resources to create a better Earth.
He touched on extraterrestrials at the World Government Summit, a global platform dedicated to shaping the future of government worldwide.
Each year, the Summit sets the agenda for the next generation of governments with a focus on how they can harness innovation and technology to solve universal challenges facing humanity.
When I was a kid I was wondering, kind of, what’s the meaning of life, like, why are we here, what’s it all about? I came to the conclusion that what really matters is trying to understand the right questions to ask, and, the more that we can increase the scope and scale of human consciousness, the better we are able to ask these questions. . . .
Some of those things are in the long term, having long term sustainable transport and sustainable energy generation, and to be a space-bearing civilization, and for humanity to be out there among the stars,  and be a multi-planetary species. I think being a multi-planet species and being out there among the stars is important for the long term survival of humanity. . . . It creates a sense of adventure, and it makes people excited about the future.
I think Musk is right — they are probably already watching us, we just don’t realize it yet. But things are changing. Numerous efforts are being made to educate the public on this subject, from the most credible sources available. Scientific publications, video footage, and photos have already been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals for a number of  years.
.
Movies and television shows bombard us constantly with stories of extraterrestrial invasions, and despite all of the evidence available, the fact that we are being and have been visited by extraterrestrials can be a scary thought, particularly given the way extraterrestrials are typically portrayed.
With a massive disinformation campaign that has focused on covering up these facts for decades, along with the mass ridicule of this subject for anyone who took it seriously in the past, it quickly escaped the minds of the masses and many people considered the notion of ongoing intelligent contact with our planet from extraterrestrials completely preposterous.
One the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re not longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.
There are objects in our atmosphere which are technically miles in advance of anything we can deploy, that we have no means of stopping them coming here … [and] that there is a serious possibility that we are being visited and have been visited for many years by people from outer space, from other civilizations.
That it behooves us, in case some of these people in the future or now should turn hostile, to find out who they are, where they come from, and what they want.
This should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation and not the subject of ‘rubishing’ by tabloid newspapers.
All this being said, the fact that UFOs/extraterrestrials is one of the most searched subjects on the web suggests that people are at least curious to learn the truth.
Humanity is waking up to the fact that this type of thing has been happening for quite some time, and the realization comes at a time when humanity is experiencing a massive shift in consciousness. By ‘shift in consciousness,’ I mean that we are letting go of long-held beliefs that have been rendered obsolete by new evidence.
That being said, no matter how much evidence presents itself, it’s always going to be difficult to let go of belief systems, but minds are indeed opening. It was great to see Musk mention the topic of consciousness in his talk as well as mention that it’s important to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness, and part of increasing that scope, as Musk identifies, is asking the right questions.
Some of these questions deal with pulling back the veil that’s blinded the masses for decades. It’s not that we aren’t smart enough, but rather that we have been lied to and misled for years.
Acknowledging the fact that we are  being visited opens up so many questions in all fields, from religion, to history, to new theories of scientific knowledge and many more, as I am sure you can imagine.
If they have been around, and have been watching us, why has there not been major contact? There is sufficient evidence showing that contact has indeed occurred on an individual level, with perhaps millions of people, but a ‘one time’ mass disclosure event has yet to take place.
What propulsion systems do they use? UFOs that are tracked on military radar and visually confirmed by pilots have performed maneuvers that completely defy our known laws of physics, and make maneuvers no known aircraft on Earth can.
.
I’ve been studying the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon for a very long time, and one common theme that constantly comes up is a shift in consciousness, a change in the way we see and care for our planet, and a deeper understanding about life and the true nature of reality.
Can we work together, can we solve these problems in order to become the spacefaring race that Musk so passionately speaks of? It seems other civilizations have done so, civilizations that have probably already tackled and overcome these same problems we now face.
That being said, spirituality doesn’t really have the same negative connotations that religion has, lacking its long history of violence, subjugation, and corruption. Spirituality isn’t concerned with converting people to specific beliefs and behaviors.
It has roots in the most ancient of history, and also correlations with a lot of science that’s emerging today, mainly in the areas of quantum physics and neuroscience, which are now revealing the vast interconnectedness of all things. I think it would be wise to assume that this interconnectedness is not only planetary, but interplanetary and beyond.
A big part of the extraterrestrial question coincides with this type of ‘spirituality.’ While there will always be people who are quick to label aliens as angels or demons, perhaps the best approach is, as the Dalai Lama emphasized a few years ago, to view ‘them’ as ‘us,’ and refuse the urge to label and judge them.
The spiritual aspect of this topic is also emphasized in indigenous lore from all over the world.
At the end of the day, all of the research I and many have others have done suggests that something special is happening, and there are many out there watching us, and perhaps assisting us in ways we do not know, to see if we can succeed in making the human experience beneficial for all life on the planet.
Part of that is waking up to all of the lies and deceit that plagues this planet, presenting solutions to our problems, and then implementing those solutions. Many barriers may stand in the way of this progress, but we can’t break them down until they are at least identified.
This is one aspect of the massive shift in consciousness that’s occurring right now, and how it may tie to the supposed “super intelligent aliens” that may not only be visiting us right now, but walking among us.
Perhaps extraterrestrial contact can help us find out who we are and where we come from. There is a bigger picture here, and it requires us to let go of all of our judgements and destructive ways of life, and embrace the interconnectedness of all that is.
What do you think? I’ll end this article with a great video that can give us all something to think about. There is ample reason to believe that these changes spoken below are directly correlated with some of the extraterrestrial groups currently visiting our planet. Obviously Rainn mentions nothing of that topic, but that’s not why I’m sharing this video.

http://csglobe.com/gop-front-runner-california-senate-seat-hates-jews-loves-hitler-wants-destroy-us/
GOP front-runner for California Senate seat hates Jews, loves Hitler, and wants to destroy the U.S.
No wonder Patrick Little has received David Duke's endorsement.
to deport Jewish people from the U.S., says Adolf Hitler is the “second coming of Christ,” and has called for the “Balkanization” of America.
He’s also, according a recent poll from SurveyUSA, the leading contender challenging Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) for her seat this fall.
, nearly 20 percent of respondents said they would vote for Little. His supporters included nearly a quarter of Californians over the age of 50, and nearly half of the state’s Republicans.
Out of nowhere, and with almost no name recognition before this year, Little became the latest extremist to attach his name to the Republican Party — and swiftly became the likeliest candidate to take his rank anti-Semitism, genocide denial, and white supremacy to Congress.
To be sure, there’s no guarantee Little — who has expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump in the past — will come anywhere near those SurveyUSA numbers when California holds its open primary on June 5, sending the top two respondents to the state’s November Senate election.
from its convention.
, executive director of the California GOP.
In a video later posted on BitChute, Little, a former Marine and IT specialist, confirmed his ejection from the GOP convention.
, Little railed against the decision, peppering his rant with a number of conspiracy theories he has embraced.
Little also revealed that he attended last year’s “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a fellow white supremacist killed one protester and injured nearly two dozen others.
Like Richard Spencer, who also attended the rally — and is currently facing a lawsuit for his own actions in Charlottesville — Little also called for the “Balkanization” of the U.S., shattering the country into separate racial enclaves.
— it’s unclear how much of a dent the state GOP’s decision to boot Little will make in his chances.
Even if Little doesn’t make the cutoff to face Feinstein this fall, his stock has already risen considerably among fellow white supremacists. Little’s account on Gab, a white supremacist chat site, is peppered with support from anonymous white supremacists and memes of him stomping on the Israeli flag.
“All you California guys need to vote in the primary and get him in there!” one said. “[Little] will wake up so many people. If you live in California, it’s time to tell the truth to the conservatives you know,” another added.

http://csglobe.com/14-amazing-psychology-facts-you-should-keep-to-yourself/
Up until only fairly recently psychology and philosophy were thought to go hand in hand. It was only during the 1870’s when psychology became an independent scientific discipline. Since then through multiple studies and technological advances, we have learnt a great deal although still only scratched the surface.
1.
If you announce your goals to others, you are less likely to make them happen because you lose motivation, studies confirmed.
There have been tests since as early as 1933 that prove that once intended goals are announced, people are less likely to follow through with them as they lose motivation.
This is thought to happen because doing so satisfies a person’s self-identity just enough to prevent them performing the hard work to achieve those goals.
2. Most people have a favorite song because they associate it with an emotional event in their lives.
It is well known that music has a direct effect on emotion. In a recent study on nine undergraduate students, it turns out that the flip side is also true – similar in a way that certain smells can remind us of moments in the past.
3. Music affects the way you perceive the world.
A new study held at the University of Groningen has shown that music has a dramatic effect on perception. The study focused especially on the ability of people to “see” happy faces and sad faces when different music tracks were listened to. Listening to particularly happy or sad music can even change the way we perceive the world.
.
Research performed by Harvard Business School has shown that people are actually happier when they give money to others. Of course, this should go without saying as we often anticipate how people will react to our own gifts at Christmas, more so than what gifts we may receive.
5. According to studies, you’ll be happier spending your money on experiences rather than possessions.
Happiness has become an increasingly popular field focused on the scientific study of emotional well-being. Research has suggested that people often sacrifice things that make them happy such as vacations or going out to certain events, in order to afford possessions (such as property).
6. Kids are more highly strung today, with high school students showing the same level of anxiety as the average psychiatric patient in the 1950’s.
Approximately 49% of the general population suffer or have suffered from anxiety, depression or substance abuse. In particular, there is proof that the collective human race is becoming more anxious every decade and there are many speculative reasons for that. For instance, people move more, have less interaction with their communities, change jobs, are less likely to get married and more likely to live alone.
7. It has been shown that certain religious practices like prayer and attending services is associated with lower psychological distress levels.
“The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Mood Disorders” discusses several studies that have demonstrated that people who partake in various religious activities may have a lower risk of depressive symptoms and other psychological disorders.
8. While money can buy happiness to an extent, studies show that after $75,000 per year, increased income does little to boost happiness.
A study of 450,000 Americans in 2008 and 2009 suggested that there are two forms of happiness, emotional well-being (day to day contentment) and an overall life assessment. The more money people had, the higher their “life assessment”. However, findings suggests that once people earn more than $75,000, additional income is simply considered more “stuff”.
9. By surrounding yourself with happier people, you’ll become happier too.
shows that stress and happiness are both contagious, and being around groups of either type has a direct influence on us.
10. People between the ages of 18 and 33 are the most stressed in the world. After the age of 33 stress levels tend to reduce.
According to a 2012 Stress in America survey by the American Psychological Association, people between the ages of 18 and 33 are the most stressed out, and that stress only seems to be increasing every year.
11. Fooling yourself into thinking you’ve slept well, even if you haven’t, still improves performance.
We’ve all been in that situation when we wished for just one or two more hours’ sleep. A recent study published by the Journal of Experimental Psychology demonstrated that when patients were told they had above average REM sleep (when they hadn’t), they performed better on a given test. They called it “placebo sleep”.
12. Intelligent people are more likely to underestimate themselves, while ignorant people are more likely to believe they’re brilliant.
, some unskilled people believe they are superior and assess their own abilities as much higher than what is accurate. On the other side of the coin, some highly skilled people often underestimate their competence, assuming that what is easy for them, is also easy for others.
13. If you remember a past event, you’re actually remembering the last time you remembered it rather than the event itself.
One interesting insight into how the brain works, is that every time we have a memory, we transform it slightly. Recent research conducted by Northwestern Medicine has shown that recalling memories often, makes them less accurate over time.
14. Decisions become more rational if they are thought in a foreign language.
A recent study by the University of Chicago conducted on United States and Korean citizens has shown that thinking in a foreign language reduces deep seated and misleading biases.

in saying NO to genetically modified organisms.
The tribe has just announced that it is implementing a ban on all GM crops and GM animals.
A committee meant to review the Yurok Tribe Genetically Engineered Organism (GEO) Ordinance, which was first allowed public comment, has now been enacted this December, 2015.
The Tribal GEO Ordinance prohibits the propagation, raising, growing, spawning, incubating, or releasing of genetically engineered organisms (such as growing GMO crops or releasing genetically engineered salmon) within the Tribe’s territory and declares the Yurok Reservation to be a GMO-free zone.
It is the first ordinance of its kind in the Nation.
This tribe previously tried to protect their land and rivers from genetically modified salmon, and now have decided that all GM crops and animals pose a serious threat.
The Yurok Tribe’s homeland is on the Klamath River, where massive algal blooms, exacerbated by agricultural runoff and antiquated hydroelectric dams, turn the river toxic each summer.

A Virginia father posted a Facebook video that he says shows his 10-year-old son running to school in the rain as a form of punishment for bullying in school and being banned from the school bus.
Bryan Thornhill said his technique is working. He said his son was “out of his mind” last week and — since the punnishment — has not gotten into trouble.

Thornhill said it is important for kids to be held accountable for their actions. He said his son ran a mile to school for one week and joked that he kept a pretty good pace, running six-minute miles.
reported that the video was posted on March 1 and has since been viewed over 1.6 million times.
The vast majority of comments from viewers have been positive.
Some commenters were critical of the technique, especially over the fact the boy was running in the rain.

http://csglobe.com/social-engineering-via-media/
Ever pay attention to trends in the media? Some stories and narratives rise and fall in cycles, along with your awareness of them.
It’s kind of like a shell game, where the street hustler directs your attention to one shell as a distraction while he shuffles aside the nut with the goods in it. A ‘now you see it, now you don’t,’ kind of thing.
, you can bet that it’s something you’re supposed to be looking at.
, and as corporations do, they rule by memos from up high.
Tonight show host Conan O’Brien knows this, and he rips on the media for the insane homogenization of local news.
He does this bit where his team edits together actual footage of local newscasters from around the country saying the exact same thing, word for word, but, each anchor-person personalizes it with their own inflection, pausing, intonation and so on.
It’s hilarious, but at the same time disturbing because it shockingly demonstrates how ideas are forced into the mainstream of today’s corporate culture.
Have a look. This always cracks me up. Not in a ‘ha ha’ sort of way, though, more like in a ‘ha ha, aren’t we gullible,’ kind of way. Big difference.
The point is, when you see a story being played over and again on various news outlets, you have good reason to believe that the information isn’t coming to you organically. It’s not something you really need to know or something that is genuinely relevant to day-to-day life in your community.
It’s the execution of an agenda. The information is being deliberately disseminated to manufacture awareness and recalibrate the standard for normal. It’s something the corporate media wants you to focus on. Like in the shell game.
When you understand this fundamental of corporate media, the landscape of information today looks totally different. You’re able to see narratives unfold and evolve, and able to recognize when your attention is deliberately being drawn towards an issue. Or away from an issue.
Here’s a few examples from the present that when taken as everyday happenstance may seem benign, but have serious implications for the future of society and for the human race at large.
The fact that these issues are being presented with noticeable frequency these days is a red flag that there is some larger agenda in the works. The norms, values and standards in our culture are being tweaked, or twerked, and attacked by the repetition of such information.
This is perhaps one of the most common issues thrust on the public in order to fabricate widespread public support for a questionable and very profitable practice. The one-sidedness of the debate on this sensitive issued has successfully created a society where people now openly demand forced medical procedures on others to alleviate a perceived fear.
This is the idea that a person’s biological gender is somehow fluid against their opinion of themselves. There is an apparent effort to make us believe that those with confusion over their gender are horribly oppressed and in danger, and that they need to be protected with censorship and speech laws.
The aim here is to promote the virtues of censorship, and to develop a generation of people who don’t value procreation and the advancement of the human race, but rather shallow social issues and a perceived sense of justice.
as the future of companionship. News stories on the latest advancements in robot sex dolls are ubiquitous these days.
We are being told they make great life partners and that they sufficiently synthesize the experience of being with a real woman (or man).
by persuading us that sex with plastic and electronics is as good as or better than the real thing. Look for birth rates to decline further as these creepy sex toys become more popular.
Some call this the ‘mark of the beast,’ but the idea of microchipping people for their supposed convenience is being pushed out onto all the major media channels as a great way to take part in our technological future.
make it seem as though chipping is fashionable.
These are just a few examples, but the technique in play here is a fundamental method of social engineering via media.
Among the regular flow of info, certain topics or subjects are thrust into public consciousness with regularity. The issues are never quite framed as critically important, but rather positioned as matter-of-fact, sign-of-the-times. Opposing arguments or viewpoints are never fully explored.
Frame it in such a way that it seems exciting and cutting edge. Normalize it by mixing it in with everyday things, and repeating it. Make it seem like the future is here now, and that there is a bandwagon you need to get in on order to be part of the gang.
This method works. It’s called conditioning. An idea as reprehensible as exchanging human-on-human love for sex with elaborate robots would have been shocking and totally unacceptable a few generations ago. But, slowly raise awareness of the wonders of this new technology over time, and people become curious rather than repulsed. It becomes normalized.
There really is nothing you can do about living in such a changing world, except opt-out of the insanity, stupidity and self-destructive tendencies being framed as wholesome cultural advances.
To make good decisions in this regard, it’s imperative to be able to process information in a way that acknowledges the true nature of corporate/government propaganda.

http://csglobe.com/eradicated-disease-could-come-back-terrifying-biological-weapon/
Smallpox has been eradicated since 1989, but scientists worry that that’s a false sense of security.
, explores in one episode how smallpox—eradicated in 1980—could make a surprising, deadly comeback.
That might seem inherently at odds with what we think about smallpox, a disease that starts as a fever with red bumps that become painful blisters within and outside the body, ultimately causing up to half of people afflicted with it to die.
There is no cure, and smallpox permanently scars not only the body but a person’s organs.
But thanks to a staggering effort fronted by the World Health Organization, the disease was eradicated in 1980.
The disease isn’t dead, however. Labs around the world hold vials of smallpox in the event of an emergency, stockpiles that were supposed to be destroyed by 2002 but weren’t after 9/11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks made bioterror a real, looming threat.
The CDC still holds reserves, in addition to enough vaccinations and treatments in the event of a surprise eruption of smallpox.
It would seem to suggest the disease and all its future iterations would be under control, but a brewing debate among policymakers and those who study smallpox biology suggests the possibility of a weaponized new strain of smallpox.
In January, David Evans, a virologist at the University of Alberta in Canada, and his colleagues, published a paper in PLOS One that shook national security experts.
In it, Evans described how he and two colleagues went about ordering DNA fragments on the Internet, carefully pieced them together, created horsepox (a smallpox cousin that can’t affect humans), and published their work—to much backlash.
Why? Security experts and public health officials argued that what Evans and his team had essentially published was a recipe for making smallpox at home and disseminating it.
Evans refused to comment on his study to The Daily Beast, instead pointing questions to a colleague unrelated to the study, an emeritus professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the University of Florida, Richard Condit.
Condit’s laboratory studied smallpox, among other pox viruses, for nearly 40 years. “I actually think it’s fair to say I played a role in helping to develop a lot of the techniques used to create synthetic pox virus,” he told The Daily Beast while driving from his home in Austin back to Gainesville.
are simple genetic systems,” he said.
That doesn’t mean that viruses like smallpox should be overlooked or scoffed at, however: Their operation is extremely complex and intricate. “The most unusual thing about pox viruses is that they are the only viruses that contain DNA and don’t replicate outside of the cell,” he explained.
Smallpox is also unique in that it has its own complete replication system. That’s unusual among viruses, which normally have to encode DNA outside the cell. Smallpox, however, is autonomous, encoding this replication machinery within the cell. This leads to smallpox’s biochemical complexity; according to Condit, the simplest viruses have five genes. Smallpox contains about 200.
“As viruses go, it’s a relatively complex organism,” he said. “I don’t think any one can tell you why it’s so deadly”—and a lot of that probably has to do with the fact that it’s so complicated.
That, in a nutshell, is how to make a smallpox virus.
fragments are available, viable, and can be bought on the Internet.
That accessibility is in fact what makes many policymakers nervous. Condit said that if his lab were still running, it would take just some scientists and money to throw a virus together.
“First you have to have a laboratory that is equipped to do biomedical science, with incubators to grow a million cells, supplies, personnel that is knowledgeable,” he ticked off.
In short: Even on the expensive side, recreating a synthetic smallpox virus in a lab would take trained professionals around $3 million to do.
That’s cheap—especially for a state sponsored terrorist organization.
Michael Osterholm, director at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, thinks that horsepox is a gateway virus of sorts towards manipulating what we know about smallpox into a viable strain that would wreak havoc.
What especially concerns Osterholm is the fact that the recipe for creating smallpox is out for the taking. Evans’ paper made ripples not only because he was able to create horsepox from scratch but moreso because it was published—which means people with nefarious intent could reproduce horsepox and tweak it enough to become smallpox. “The principles of making horsepox virus are not different [from smallpox],” Osterholm said.
Evans’ lab was not the first to piece together DNA to create a pox. In 2001, Australian researchers published a paper in The Journal of Virology that pointed to experiments done in 1998 and 1999 where researchers—who were actually trying to make mice infertile and didn’t publish results for a couple years because they were debating if it was morally responsible to do so—dropped a gene into the mousepox virus.
The mice, even if they were vaccinated, were eviscerated.
Experiments like Evans and the mousepox virus that was adjusted to become deadlier show Osterholm that it’s very much in the realm of possibility for humans to make a smallpox virus that’s much more frightening than its original form, despite the fact that Condit invoked a common phrase in science—“mice lie and monkeys exaggerate”—to suggest animal experiments aren’t necessarily translatable to humans.
Condit echoed this statement. “Sure, that’s right—a well-equipped and knowledgeable lab could do this,” he said. “David’s [Evans] experiment is proof of principle.” The only thing a group would have to do to create smallpox that wasn’t horsepox? According to Condit, it would be to use synthetic DNA instead of fragments that previously already existed.
Osterholm and Condit also differ in their thoughts about the future of smallpox in being used as a bioweapon is our preparedness.
Osterholm added that while smallpox could be contained quickly in the United States thanks to established public health measure practices, an incident in a region where an immunological response plan isn’t set up could be dangerous, particularly in an age of air travel.
Osterholm said that in a scenario where a smallpox virus was created in a laboratory the creator might not be able to remain anonymous; the genes would be able to be traced, the methods and strains used found. “It would be a blowback if an epidemic was traced back to a government,” he said, changing a world order where such an attack would be considered a blatant human rights offense.

, the Soviet Union and the United States found themselves locked in a chilling race to nuke the moon, declassified military documents reveal.
Following the end of the Second World War in 1945, the USSR and the USA spent decades trying to prove their military might to the world.
During this tense era, the two superpowers found themselves locked in an arms race that saw them spend decades scrambling to develop the most powerful armaments.
As the arms race morphed into a space race, the two nations set their sights on the moon and made it their goal to extend their influence beyond the Earth’s atmosphere.
Now, newly declassified documents reveal just how far the superpowers were prepared to go, as they hatched terrifying plans to obliterate part of the moon with a nuclear strike.
, the plan cooked up by the US Air Force in 1958 set out how America could prove its might once and for all.
Physicist Leonard Reiffel was put in charge of the project, which had the terrifying goal of detonating a nuclear warhead on the moon.
The team of military and physics experts planned to explode a warhead the same size as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima on our planet’s natural satellite.
The detonation would light up the moon’s surface, generating a sphere of dust that would blot out any hopes of Russia winning the arms race.
At the time, the team believed it could feasibly hit a target on the moon within an accuracy of two miles.
However, by January 1959, US military bosses were convinced that the public backlash against such a senseless strike would be enormous, and the risks of a malfunction in the launch were too great.
After that realization, America’s leaders turned their attention to putting people, rather than weapons, in space.
Meanwhile, the Soviets were cooking up a scheme of their own as part of a project codenamed E-4.
This plan involved striking the moon with a nuclear missile of their own, although this plot faced the same overwhelming risks and difficulties as the Americans’ secret plans.
